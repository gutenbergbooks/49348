Preface to 1st Edition


When the Territorial System was adopted in 1881, the old titles
borne by our regiments were, in many cases, changed, and in other
instances entirely lost. When the old titles changed, the Nicknames,
by which nearly every corps was known, disappeared. These Nicknames
often brought to mind some amusing event or memorable incident in the
regiment's career, and in many cases originated from some peculiarity
in the uniform, or, in the case of a cavalry regiment, the colour of
the horses. There is no official record kept of these Nicknames, as
they were wholly unrecognised by the "Army List"; it is, therefore,
hoped that the record of the old names and titles as shown in this work
will be appreciated.

FOREWORD


The sudden expansion of the British Army to a strength undreamed of
prior to August, 1914, brought in its train an ever-increasing desire
on the part of the public for a better knowledge of the Army and of its
glorious traditions, a subject that had previously attracted little
or no attention outside military circles. Even among an average body
of soldiers there is curiously enough a lack of knowledge of military
history outside that closely associated with their own regiment. Yet
the history of the British Army is unequalled by any other in the
world for splendid achievement, while the regimental histories and
traditions teem with instances of devotion to duty, gallantry in the
face of overwhelming odds, and self-sacrifice of the most glorious
nature. These traditions are highly treasured in the regiments, and
their preservation has tended to build up and sustain in each unit
that splendid _esprit de corps_ which has animated all ranks, and made
almost the impossible possible to our gallant soldiers in the presence
of hardships and danger, and has led them to face death with a courage
and heroism unsurpassed in the history of the world.

The traditions of the British Army stretch back over four centuries,
during which it has been the acknowledged means of winning and building
up the greatest Empire the world has ever known. The Army's deeds are
a sealed book so far as the general public are concerned, for military
matters except in times of actual war have never been a popular
subject, the great heroes of the battlefield being far less known to
the British public than popular performers on the football field or
pampered professional boxers.


THE ROMANCE OF MILITARY HISTORY

The history of the British Army is full of romance and interest and
many curious customs, incidents and observances are associated with
most of the regiments. Each regiment has peculiarities of custom which
it has made its own by long use, besides winning unofficial titles and
nicknames commemorative of some deed of daring or peculiarity of dress
or tradition. The following pages deal with these, and if in perusing
them the reader is encouraged to learn more of the glorious history
and traditions of the British Army, which he will do with increasing
satisfaction and interest, the author will feel amply rewarded.

Although outwardly all regiments or battalions of one branch of the
service are alike to the ordinary observer, there are, however, many
little differences distinguishing them. These little differences are
for the most part the sole remaining links with those gallant regiments
of the past from which they have descended, and whose glorious
achievements are a subject of great pride to all ranks. For instance,
in the Royal Artillery there may be no difference to be detected
between the various batteries or companies, yet each has traditions
and subtle differences highly prized, as for instance the Chestnut
Troop, the Rocket Troop, and the Battleaxe Company, all reminiscent of
glorious incidents in their history.


CAVALRY DISTINCTIONS

The Household Cavalry are now the only British Cavalry still wearing
the polished steel cuirass. Yet each of the regiments has little
differences apparent only to the close observer. Thus, the 1st Life
Guards wear a red cord as their shoulder belts and black sheep-skins
on their saddles, the 2nd Life Guards wearing a blue cord and white
sheep-skins. The seven regiments of Dragoon Guards differ somewhat from
each other in point of uniform. They, with the Royal Engineers, are
the only regiments in the army to wear velvet facings. Their helmets
are of brass, the helmets of the Household Cavalry and Dragoons being
of white metal. The three regiments of Dragoons are representative of
England, Scotland and Ireland, being the 1st Royal Dragoons, Royal
Scots Greys and Inniskilling Dragoons, the Greys being distinctive by
reason of the colour of their horses and their bearskin head-dress.

Each of the twelve regiments of Hussars, introduced into the service in
1806 as Light Dragoons, has also certain distinctions of dress, as also
have the six regiments of Lancers, the best known of which is perhaps
the 17th Lancers on account of its grim crest, a skull with crossbones,
which, with its motto "Or Glory" has led to its popular name of "The
Death or Glory Boys." It is an interesting fact that the 17th Lancers
in 1795 provided a detachment for service on H.M.S. "Hermione" as
Marines, and were promptly nicknamed "The Horse Marines." Lancer
regiments were introduced into the British Army in 1816.

Each regiment of Dragoon Guards carries a standard on ceremonial
occasions, and Dragoon regiments carry a guidon (a swallow-tailed
standard). Hussar and Lancer regiments do not carry standards, bearing
their battle honours on their appointments.


PRIVILEGES OF THE FOOT GUARDS

The regiments of Foot Guards, known as the Brigade of Guards, have many
privileges and duties reserved to them alone. They claim the privilege
of guarding the Royal Palaces and form part of the Household Troops
of the Sovereign. The First Company of the 1st Battalion Grenadier
Guards is known as the King's Company and is comprised of picked men
of particularly fine physique, none under 6 feet in height being
admitted to it. This company has the right to carry on parade on state
and ceremonial occasions a colour of crimson silk, the gift of the
Sovereign, being the only company in the Army so privileged. The First
Company of the Welsh Guards, formed in 1915, is known as The Prince of
Wales's Company, and is also composed of picked men. The Scots Guards
is the only regular Scottish regiment to have drum and fife bands. The
Quartermasters of the Brigade of Guards wear cocked hats with plumes,
the Grenadier and Scots Guards, white; the Coldstream Guards, red; and
the Irish Guards, blue. The sergeant-majors of the Foot Guards wear an
elaborate Royal Coat of Arms on their right sleeves above the elbow.

No chevrons or badges are worn by staff-sergeants of the Foot Guards in
undress uniform.

The Royal or King's Colour in regiments of Foot Guards is of crimson
silk, and bears the distinctions conferred by Royal authority. The
regimental colour of Foot Guards is the Union Jack, and battle honours
are borne on both colours. The King's Colour of the Infantry of the
Line is the Union Jack, with the regimental badge superimposed, but
the regimental colour is distinctive in each regiment and the battle
honours are borne on these alone.


PIPERS' PECULIARITIES

Regarding pipers it is a curious fact that the Regulations provide
for an issue of fifes to Scottish regiments but not bagpipes, which
have to be provided regimentally, although with the exception of the
Scots Guards, the fifes are never drawn from stores. In the Royal
Scots, Royal Scots Fusiliers, King's Own Scottish Borderers and
Scottish Rifles, pipers are officially borne on the strength, but no
clothing allowed for them, which has to be provided regimentally. The
sergeant-pipers of the Scots Guards alone wear a crown and silver
chevrons on their doublet sleeves, all other sergeant-pipers wearing
gold chevrons without a crown.

There are many interesting peculiarities connected with uniforms or
accoutrements. The Kilmarnock bonnets worn by the Royal Scots and
King's Own Scottish Borderers, which were designed and issued for wear
after the South African War, are quite distinctive, as also are the
chacos of the Scottish Rifles and Highland Light Infantry, the former
having a plume in front and the latter a ball. The Queen's Royal West
Surrey Regiment is the only regiment in the Army wearing a sacred
emblem as a badge, while the Buffs (East Kent Regiment) claim to have a
far more ancient lineage than any other English regiment.


ANIMAL BADGES

The King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment wears the Lion of England
for a badge, and it is interesting to note that many other regiments
go to the animal kingdom for their crests, the Royal Warwickshire
Regiment wearing an antelope as a badge; the King's Liverpool
Regiment, West Yorkshire Regiment and Royal West Kent Regiment, a
horse; the Buffs, the Scottish Rifles, Royal Berkshire Regiment, North
Staffordshire Regiment and York and Lancaster Regiment, a dragon; the
Gordon Highlanders, Royal Munster Fusiliers, Royal Dublin Fusiliers,
Leicestershire Regiment and Hampshire Regiment, a tiger; the West
Riding Regiment, Connaught Rangers, Seaforth Highlanders, and the
Highland Light Infantry, an elephant; the Royal Irish Fusiliers,
an eagle; the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, a cat; and the
Bedfordshire Regiment, a stag.


QUICK STEPPING INFANTRY

The Light Infantry regiments wear a bugle or French horn as part of
their badge, and together with Rifle regiments march with a much
quicker step than do other infantry regiments. The regulation pace is
120 to the minute, but Rifle and Light Infantry regiments step much
quicker, 140 to 160, except when marching with other troops, then their
pace is that laid down for the army generally. They have bugle bands
instead of drum and fife bands.

The Northumberland Fusiliers are the only regiment to celebrate St.
George's Day, and are looked upon as the representative English
infantry regiment in the British Army and their crest of St. George and
the Dragon is unique.

All Fusilier regiments wear sealskin fusilier caps with distinctive
plumes, and a grenade as a badge. The Royal Fusiliers is best known
as the City of London Regiment, and has some peculiar privileges in
consequence, one of these being the right to march through the City
of London with fixed bayonets, colours flying, and drums beating,
without first obtaining the permission of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen.
This privilege is shared by the Buffs, the Grenadier Guards and Royal
Marines only.

The Norfolk Regiment has a curious crest, being the figure of Britannia
as it used to appear on the copper coinage, and is the only regiment
not having a Royal title, of which His Majesty is Colonel-in-Chief. The
Lincolnshire Regiment was for some years after being raised the only
British regiment of infantry to wear blue coats.


THE MINDEN REGIMENTS

The Suffolk Regiment was one of the six regiments of British infantry
that performed the remarkable feat of charging and utterly destroying a
column of French cavalry, superior in numbers to themselves. This was
at Minden, the other five regiments being the Lancashire Fusiliers,
Royal Welsh Fusiliers, King's Own Scottish Borderers, Hampshire
Regiment and the Yorkshire Light Infantry. The regiments passed to the
battlefield through gardens of roses in full bloom, and the soldiers
picked the blossoms and fixed them in their hats, and in commemoration
of their victory they enjoy the right of wearing roses in their
head-dress on the anniversary of the battle.

The Prince Albert's Somerset Light Infantry has two peculiar
distinctions, one being that it is the only regiment without a Royal
title to wear blue for its facings, and the other being that the
sergeants enjoy the right of wearing their sashes over the left
shoulder the same as the officers, in commemoration of their devoted
gallantry at the battle of Culloden, when the casualties among the
officers were so numerous that the sergeants were left in command.

The Cheshire Regiment also enjoys a peculiar privilege, that of wearing
oak leaves in its head-dress and as a wreath on its colour staves on
all Royal ceremonial parades, in commemoration of its rally round its
Sovereign who took shelter at a critical moment beneath an oak tree
during the battle of Dettingen.


WELSH TRADITIONS

Among the peculiarities of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers is that of
wearing a bunch of black ribbons fastened to the back of the collar.
This is a survival of the patch of black leather which in former days
was worn by all soldiers on the back to prevent the grease from the
powdered pigtails from soiling the tunics. The regiment also enjoys the
privilege, common to all Welsh regiments, of being led on parade by a
goat, these animals being generally gifts from the Sovereign.

The South Wales Borderers have a highly-prized distinction, that of
bearing a silver wreath of immortelles fastened to their King's colour,
in commemoration of the devoted bravery of the regiment in the Zulu War.

All the Welsh regiments carry on their colours, or as badges, the
device of the Plume of the Prince of Wales, the Rising Sun, and the Red
Dragon of Cadwaladr.

The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers were for many years the only regiment
in the British Army using the old Irish war pipes, but now other Irish
regiments have adopted the custom and possess full pipe bands. The
Irish war pipe has but two drones, as distinctive from the Scottish
bagpipes which have three.


THE GLORY OF THE GLOUCESTERS AND WORCESTERS

The Gloucestershire Regiment has a unique distinction, that of wearing
a miniature replica of its badge at the back of its head-dress,
bestowed for its gallantry at the battle of Alexandria, when being
suddenly attacked front and rear simultaneously, the rear ranks of the
regiment turned about and beat the enemy off.

The Worcestershire Regiment has as its motto the word "Firm," bestowed
for steadiness in the face of the foe, and naturally highly prized.

The Duke of Wellington's West Riding Regiment enjoys two peculiar
distinctions, the first that of being the only regiment in the British
Army bearing the name of anyone except a Royal personage as part of its
title, and also of being the only regiment to wear scarlet facings to
its red tunics.


THE BORDERS' UNIQUE HONOUR

The Border Regiment alone among the regiments of the Army bears the
battle honour of "Arroyo dos Molinos," although a number of regiments
took part in that great battle.

The Welsh Regiment, like the Welsh Guards, has a motto in the Welsh
language. The former served with distinction as marines on board the
fleet under Lord Nelson.

The Black Watch wears a red hackle or feather in its bonnets, a
distinction won on the battlefield, and its pipers are the only ones in
the army wearing feather bonnets instead of glengarry caps.


THE GREENJACKETS

The King's Royal Rifle Corps and the Rifle Brigade are known as the
Greenjackets, from the colour of their full dress uniform, and like
all Rifle regiments wear fur busbies. They do not carry colours, their
battle honours being emblazoned on their appointments. They do not
carry their rifles at the slope but at the trail. There are two other
Rifle regiments in the British Army, these being the Scottish Rifles
(The Cameronians) and the Royal Irish Rifles.


THE ELEPHANT COLOURS.

The Highland Light Infantry and Seaforth Highlanders enjoy the
privilege of carrying a third colour on parade, this having been
presented to them to commemorate their bravery at the battle of
Assaye, and being emblazoned with an elephant is known as the Assaye
or Elephant Colour. The Seaforth is the only regiment to have a Gaelic
motto.

The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders have a larger proportion of
Gaelic-speaking soldiers in their ranks than any other, most of them
hailing from the most northern part of the Highlands.


BATTLE HONOURS.

Before the great war on the Continent the King's Royal Rifle Corps
were credited with the highest number of battle honours, viz.,
40, the Gloucester Regiment being second with 34, then in order
the Rifle Brigade 33, Highland Light Infantry 32, Black Watch and
Gordon Highlanders 31 each, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, Royal Scots,
South Staffordshire Regiment and South Lancashire Regiment 29 each,
Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry 27, Sherwood Foresters,
Seaforth Highlanders, Royal Munster Fusiliers, Northamptonshire
Regiment and Royal Dublin Fusiliers 25 each, and The Buffs, East Surrey
Regiment and Grenadier Guards 24 each. The 16th Lancers have the
highest number of honours amongst the Cavalry regiments, viz., 18, the
9th Lancers having 16, and the 14th Hussars 15.

Many other matters of interest attaching to each regiment will be found
in the following pages.

ROYAL FLYING CORPS


The great European war brought out in startling fashion the remarkable
efficiency of the military aerial service, which is embodied in the
Naval and Military Wings of the Royal Flying Corps. The Naval Wing is
concerned chiefly with airships, while the Military Wing is devoted
to work with aeroplanes and man-carrying kites. The Corps has its
foundation in the old Balloon Company of the Royal Engineers, which
in 1911 was absorbed into the Air Battalion Royal Engineers, when
the aerial service of the army was placed on a sound basis. The
headquarters were placed at Aldershot. On April 13th, 1913, the Royal
Flying Corps was organised and developed in remarkable manner in
methods, material, and men. When war was declared against Germany in
1914 the members of the Corps quickly achieved fame by their efficiency
and daring, many decorations being won, notably the V.C. by Lieut.
Warneford, who was killed soon after in an accident near Paris.

1st LIFE GUARDS


In 1660, Charles II. before leaving Holland, formed into a troop a
body of cavalier gentlemen who had rallied round him there, which he
placed under the command of Lord Gerard. It was thus the Life Guards
originated. The corps was styled "His Majesty's Own Troop of Guards."

The Life Guards were nicknamed "Cheeses," from the old gentlemen of the
corps declining to serve in it as remodelled in 1788, saying "that it
was no longer composed of gentlemen but of cheesemongers." Also known
as "The Tin Bellies."

  NOTE "A."--In full dress N.C.O.'s of the Household Cavalry do
  not wear chevrons but aiguillettes. The titles of the ranks also
  differ from other regiments--Corporal-Major (Sergeant-Major),
  Quartermaster-Corporal-Major (Quartermaster-Sergeant),
  Squadron-Corporal-Major (Squadron-Sergeant-Major), Corporal of
  Horse (Sergeant), Corporal (Corporal), Trooper (Private). The
  Farrier-Corporals carry polished pole axes on ceremonial parades,
  and wear black plumes and blue tunics.

This Corps formed by Charles II was styled in 1660 "The Duke of
Albemarle's Troop of Guards," in 1670 "The Queen's Troop of Life
Guards," and not till 1788 the 2nd Life Guards. Life Guards were at
one time known as "Cheeses," from the old gentlemen of the corps
declining to serve in it as remodelled in 1788, saying "that it was no
longer composed of gentlemen but of cheesemongers." The name fell into
desuetude, but was revived at the battle of Waterloo, when the officer
in command shouted "Come on, Cheesemongers, charge!" Also known as "The
Tin Bellies" (from the cuirasses).

ROYAL HORSE GUARDS (The Blues)


The Royal Horse Guards is the only cavalry regiment now in existence
that formed part of the Parliamentary Army during the reign of Charles
I. In the autumn of 1660, after the Restoration, its disbandment was
ordered but not carried out, and King Charles "gave orders for raising
a regiment of horse of eight troops, of which the Earl of Oxforde was
to be Collonel, and also of a troop of horse guards." This was done
under a Royal Warrant of 26th of January, 1661. In 1690 the regiment
was called "The Oxford Blues" to distinguish it from the Earl of
Portland's (Dutch) "Horse Guards." During the campaign in Flanders
(1742-1745) it was known as "The Blue Guards," and is now popularly
called "The Blues."

1st (King's) DRAGOON GUARDS


The 1st Dragoon Guards were styled "The Queen's Regiment of Horse" when
first raised in 1685 on the accession of James II. When in Flanders
with Marlborough, the regiment wore cuirasses, and had bright yellow
facings. In 1714, in recognition of its brilliant services, the title
was changed to "The King's Regiment of Horse," and in 1746 to "The 1st
(or King's) Regiment of Dragoon Guards." A detachment of the regiment
captured the Zulu King Cetewayo after his defeat at the battle of
Ulundi. The battlefields of Flanders figure in the regiment's history
no less than four times, viz.: In 1695 under King William at the siege
of Namur; in 1704-9 under Marlborough at Schellenberg, Blenheim,
Ramillies, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet; in 1759 when it fought at Minden
and elsewhere; and in the Great War, 1914.

Nicknames: "The K.D.G.'s," also "The Trades Union."

2nd DRAGOON GUARDS (Queen's Bays)


The 2nd Dragoon Guards was raised in 1685, and in 1687 called "The 3rd
Horse," then "The Princess of Wales's Own Royal Regiment of Horse,"
in 1727 "The Queen's Own Royal Regiment of Horse," in 1746 "The 2nd
Queen's Bays, or 2nd Regiment of Dragoon Guards," and in 1767 its
present title of "Queen's Bays," from the circumstances of the corps
being entirely mounted on bay chargers, the other heavy regiments
(except the Scots Greys) having black horses. The regiment was much
distinguished for its gallantry at the battle of Almanza, and in
Flanders under King William.

Nicknames: At one time known as the "Rusty Buckles," and more popularly
as "The Bays."

3rd (Prince of Wales's) DRAGOON GUARDS


The 3rd Dragoon Guards, originally "Cuirassiers," was raised in 1685,
and after the battle of Sedgemoor its six troops were incorporated
into a regiment called "The 4th Horse." In 1746 it was named "The
3rd Regiment of Dragoon Guards," and in 1765 "The Prince of Wales's
Regiment of Dragoon Guards." At Ramillies it captured the standard and
kettledrums of the Bavarian Guards. It was the only British Cavalry
Regiment to take part in the Abyssinian campaign under Gen. Napier and
formed part of the British column that made the memorable march on
Magdala.

Nicknamed the "Old Canaries," on account of its facings being yellow,
or canary colour.

4th (Royal Irish) DRAGOON GUARDS


The 4th Dragoon Guards raised in 1685, was originally known as "Arran's
Cuirassiers," or the "6th Horse," and in 1788 "The Fourth Dragoon
Guards," and later on the words "Royal Irish" were added. Whilst on
service in Ireland it obtained the name of the "Blue Horse," from its
facings being of that colour. During the Crimean War the regiment
took part in the famous charge of the Heavy Brigade at Balaklava, a
memorable feat which has hardly received the recognition it deserved.
The regiment rode into the charge cheering madly and did terrible
execution. They are the only regiment of Dragoon Guards with an Irish
title.

Nicknames: "The Buttermilks" on account of their lengthened stay in
Ireland, during which many of the men acquired farms; and the "Mounted
Micks."

5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) DRAGOON GUARDS


The 5th Dragoon Guards was raised in 1685, and was then the "Seventh
Horse." During Marlborough's campaigns it won fame on many fields.
Led by General Cadogan in person they rode down the Bavarian Horse
Grenadier Guards, and drove them through the French infantry in rear,
capturing many standards. Its present full title, was given it in
1804, after the Irish rebellion of 1798. During this latter period it
was familiarly known as the "Green Horse," from its facings, and the
"Green Dragoon Guards." During the Crimean War the regiment took part
at Balaklava in the famous charge of the Heavy Brigade, led by their
Colonel, Yorke-Scarlett.

Nicknames: "The Old Farmers" on account of their lengthened stay in
Ireland, and the "Green Horse."

6th DRAGOON GUARDS (Carabiniers)


The 6th Dragoon Guards raised in 1685 as the "Queen Dowager's Regiment
of Horse" and became the "Queen Dowager's Cuirassiers."

William III gave the regiment its name of King's Carabiniers in 1691
as a title of honour in recognition of its distinguished services. The
name is also derived from the fact that the men were armed with long
pistols called "Carabines." Many regiments on the Continent at this
time were called Carabiniers. Its present name was given it in 1788.
It greatly distinguished itself during Marlborough's campaigns, taking
part in sieges and minor affairs without number. It was at Meerut
on the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny and rendered the most valuable
service throughout the campaign. The regiment has a very brilliant
record of service.

Nicknames: "Tichborne's Own," since the trial of Arthur Orton, Sir
Roger Tichborne having served in the regiment; and "The Carbs."

7th (Princess Royal's) DRAGOON GUARDS


The 7th Dragoon Guards was raised in 1688 by the Earl of Devonshire,
whose title it bore till 1690, when from its Colonel's name it was
called "Schomberg's Horse"; in 1742 "Ligonier's Horse," and then "The
Black Horse," and became celebrated as a model for efficiency and
discipline. In 1788 the present title, "The 7th (Princess Royal's)
Dragoon Guards," was given to it at Dettingen. The 7th captured from
the enemy a pair of kettledrums, which are now in the Officers' Mess.
A Standard carried at the battle of Dettingen was presented by King
George II to Cornet Richardson who bore it. He had received upwards of
thirty wounds, but he refused to surrender, and preserved the Standard
which is still in the possession of his descendants. Nicknames: In the
reign of George II, "The Virgin Mary's Body Guard," having been sent
to assist the army of the Archduchess Mary Theresa of Austria, also
"Strawboots," because the men wrapped straw round their legs in a wet
campaign; popularly known as "The Black Horse."

1st (Royal) DRAGOONS


The Royals originated in a troop of Cuirassiers formed in 1661, on
the marriage of Charles II with the Infanta Catherine of Portugal,
and which was sent to garrison Tangier, whence they got the name of
"Tangier Cuirassiers." In 1684 it was styled "The Royal Regiment of
Dragoons," and each troop was furnished with a crimson Standard with
badges embroidered upon them of (1) The King, (2) The Black Prince,
(3) Henry V, (4) Henry VI, (5) Henry VII (Queen Mary I), (6) Queen
Elizabeth. Towards the close of the 17th Century it was known as the
"English Horse." At the battle of Dettingen it captured the white
Standard of the French Mousquetaires Noirs. Its gallantry at the battle
of Waterloo, where it formed part of the Union Brigade, is a matter of
history.

Nicknames: "The Birdcatchers," for the capture of a French Eagle at the
battle of Waterloo, and "The Royals."

2nd DRAGOONS (Royal Scots Greys)


Raised in 1678. In 1700 the corps was known as "The Grey Dragoons,"
and "The Scots Regiment of White Horses." In 1707, "The Royal Regiment
of North British Dragoons." In 1713, "The 2nd Dragoons." And in 1866,
"The 2nd Royal North British Dragoons, Scots Greys." At Waterloo,
the regiment with a shout of "Scotland for ever," charged the French
infantry masses and almost annihilated them. In the charge the eagle of
the 45th French Regiment was captured by Sergeant Ewart; at Ramillies
(1706) the Scots Greys captured the colours of the French "Regiment du
Roi" and for this it was permitted to wear grenadier or bearskin caps.

The men have the nicknames of "Bubbly Jocks," owing to their
dress. "Bubbly Jock" being a Scottish name for a turkey cock; "The
Birdcatchers," in commemoration of the capture of an Eagle at Waterloo;
also "The Greys."

  on his being appointed colonel in 1772.




3rd (King's Own) HUSSARS


The 3rd Hussars, raised in 1685, was styled the "Queen Consort's
Regiment of Dragoons." On the accession of George I it was called the
"King's Own Dragoons." In 1861 the regiment became "Hussars." It was
nicknamed "Lord Adam Gordon's Life Guards," from that officer detaining
it for such a long period in Scotland when he commanded there.

It was also known as "Bland's Dragoons." At Dettingen the regiment
lost very heavily, and in the following year it was reviewed by the
King, who remarked with some asperity on its attenuated appearance, and
inquired whose regiment it was, and where were the rest of the men.
"The regiment is mine, your Majesty," replied the gallant Col. Bland,
"and I believe the rest are at Dettingen."

Originally raised in 1685 under the name of "The Princess Anne of
Denmark's Regiment of Dragoons," became the 4th (Queen's Own) Hussars
in 1861. As heavy cavalry the regiment fought in the Peninsular War,
some brilliant exploits were performed. In 1818 the regiment became
Light Dragoons, and the Regiment wore scarlet uniform with straw
coloured facings, the uniform afterwards being changed back to light
green. During the Crimean War it took part in the famous charge of
the Light Brigade, under its Colonel, Lord George Paget, who led them
with a cry of "Tally ho!" as they charged the enemy's guns. When the
regiment formed part of the "Army of the Indus" under Lord Keane it was
nicknamed "Paget's Irregular Horse," in consequence of its loose drill,
the result of long service in the field.

5th (Royal Irish) LANCERS


Raised as the "Royal Irish Dragoons" in 1689, and in 1858 became "The
5th (Royal Irish) Lancers." In recognition of the prominent part it
took in Marlborough's campaigns, and particularly of its distinguished
conduct at Blenheim, Marlborough directed that the captured kettledrums
should be borne at the head of the regiment, and that the establishment
should be nine troops. At Ramillies, with the Royal Scots Greys, it
cut off two battalions of the Grenadiers of Picardie, and almost
annihilated a third battalion before a body of French horse galloped to
the rescue. To this the regiment owed the privilege it formerly enjoyed
of wearing Grenadier caps like the Royal Scots Greys.

Nicknames: At one time called "The Daily Advertisers." More popularly
known as "The Redbreasts" or "Irish Lancers."

6th (Inniskilling) DRAGOONS


The regiment was raised in 1689. In 1690 the corps was styled the
"6th, or The Inniskilling Regiment of Dragoons." Its brilliant conduct
as part of the Union Brigade at the Battle of Waterloo is a matter
of history. During the Crimean War it took part in the famous charge
of the Heavy Brigade at Balaklava, a memorable feat which has hardly
received the recognition it deserved. Of more recent years the regiment
saw a great deal of active service in South Africa.

About 1715 it was known as "The Black Dragoons," from being mounted on
black horses. It achieved a high reputation for gallantry in Flanders.

Nicknames: "The old Inniskillings," and "The Skillingers." Popularly
known as "The Inniskillings," from its badge "The Castle of
Inniskilling."

7th (Queen's Own) HUSSARS


The regiment was raised in 1689 and called "Cunningham's Regiment of
Dragoons." It was, during the Peninsular War, jocularly nicknamed "The
Old Saucy Seventh," also "The Lily White Seventh," from its pale blue
uniform and white facings, and also "Young Eyes." It was at first a
Scotch Regiment, and it is the custom of its band to play "The Garb
of old Gaul" when marching past, and "Hieland Laddie" when trotting.
Also called the "Black Horse." It was the senior of the Light Dragoon
Regiments when first connected with Hussars. It distinguished itself
during the Indian Mutiny, particularly at the passage of the Betwa,
where it had a hand-to-hand fight with the enemy's cavalry in the bed
of the river. The name of the "Old Straws," or "Strawboots," originated
at Warburg, 1760. The boots of the troopers being worn out, straw-bands
were substituted for them.

8th (King's Royal Irish) HUSSARS


The 8th Hussars was raised in Ireland in 1693 and has always been
closely associated with the Emerald Isle. It was known as "St.
George's" from its Colonel's name in 1740-55; also as the "Cross
Belts" in 1768 from the circumstance that it was permitted to wear
the sword belt over the right shoulder, in place of round the waist
as usual in dragoon regiments, for its gallant conduct at the battle
of Saragossa, where it captured the belts of the Spanish cavalry. The
regimental motto "_Pristinæ virtutis memores_," was specially conferred
on their corps in commemoration of its brilliant gallantry at the
battle of Leswarree in India. During the Crimean War it formed one of
the regiments in the famous charge of the Light Brigade at the battle
of Balaklava. The 8th Hussars and 17th Lancers have seen much service
together, and they call themselves from their numbers "The Twenty
Fives."

In the Indian Mutiny five Victoria Crosses were won by the regiment.

9th (Queen's Royal) LANCERS


The regiment was originally raised in 1697, and re-embodied in 1715.
They were known as "Wynne's Dragoons," and received their title in 1830
in honour of Queen Adelaide. Soon after its formation the regiment
served continuously in Ireland for 86 years. It has seen much service
in India. It particularly distinguished itself in the first Sikh War at
Sobraon, and in the second Sikh War at Chillianwallah and Goojerat. At
the siege of Delhi the natives called them "The Delhi Spearmen," from
the good use they made of their long lances against the rebels. During
the Afghan War it took part in Lord Roberts's march to Kandahar. At one
period in its history the troopers wore crimson overalls.

10th (Prince of Wales's Own Royal) HUSSARS


Originally raised in 1697, and in 1783, was known as the "Prince of
Wales's Light Dragoons." In 1793 the Prince of Wales (afterwards George
IV) was appointed "Commandant," and in 1796 "Colonel" of the regiment.
In 1811 the title "Royal" was conferred on it.

The regiment performed good service during the Peninsular War, and at
Waterloo. It was one of the regiments summoned from India during the
Crimean War. Dressed in plain clothes, the officers and men were sent
up the Red Sea and taken across the desert to Alexandria, thence to the
seat of war.

11th (Prince Albert's Own) HUSSARS


Raised in 1697, and afterwards disbanded. Raised again in 1715 and
later received the title of the "Prince Albert's Own," because it
formed Prince Albert's escort, from Dover to Canterbury, on his arrival
in England in 1840, to be married to Queen Victoria. The regiment was
present at the Alma and at Inkerman, and was one of the five regiments
which, under the leadership of Lord Cardigan, its former Colonel,
rode "into the jaws of death," at Balaklava. One of the regiment,
Trooper Hope, also rode in the charge of the Heavy Brigade on the same
occasion. He did so without permission and started without arms.

Nicknames: "The Cherry Pickers," also "The Cherubims," from its crimson
overalls, being the only regiment in the British Army entitled to wear
overalls of that colour. Also known as "Lord Cardigan's Bloodhounds."

  It has been the custom in this regiment for the band to play five
  hymns every evening at tattoo. One version of the legend is that
  it was a punishment for breaking into a monastery during the
  Peninsular War, the punishment to last a hundred years. Another
  version is that these hymns were presented to the officers by Pope
  Pius VI for the band to play. Whoever originated the custom we can
  all sympathise with the unfortunate bandsmen who have to carry out
  the bequest.




12th (Prince of Wales's Royal) LANCERS


The regiment was raised in 1715, and served uninterruptedly in Ireland
for 76 years. It won high reputation during the Peninsular War. It
subsequently fought gallantly at Quatre Bras and at Waterloo. It was
one of the regiments summoned from India to the Crimea, proceeding
there by way of the Red Sea and across the desert to Alexandria. It
subsequently returned to India and bore a distinguished part in the
operations in Central India under Sir Hugh Rose during the Mutiny.

Nicknamed the "Supple Twelfth" at Salamanca, from its dash and rapidity
of movement, in action.

13th HUSSARS


Raised in 1715 as "Munden's Dragoons"; was known as the "Green
Dragoons" from its facings; and in the Peninsular War nicknamed the
"Ragged Brigade" for its inability to keep a trim appearance owing
to its hard and severe work during 32 actions, in which it lost 276
men and over 1,000 horses. It fought gallantly at Waterloo. It was
present throughout the Crimean War, and was engaged at the Alma and
at Inkerman. It was one of the regiments of the Light Brigade in the
famous Balaklava charge, and afterwards served before Sevastopol.

Known as "The Lilywhites," on account of its white collars on tunics
and white stripes down overalls. Also known as "The Evergreens," from
the old green facings and motto; and "The Geraniums," from the smart
dress of the officers and men.

14th (King's) HUSSARS


Originally raised in 1697 and disbanded. Again raised in 1715. It
fought with distinction through the whole of the Peninsular War from
first to last, and was engaged times without number. In the pursuit
after the battle of Vittoria, the 14th came up with Joseph Buonaparte's
carriage, from which he had but just escaped, leaving behind him
a celebrated but indescribable silver trophy called The Emperor's
Chambermaid, still widely renowned throughout the service. This is the
corps of Charles O'Malley's choice, and mustered in its ranks the ever
memorable Micky Free. In 1848 the regiment charged vastly superior
numbers of the Sikh army at the battle of Ramnuggar, losing their
Brigadier, their Colonel, and 40 officers and men, and have since been
known as the Ramnuggar Boys--the anniversary of that battle being still
observed as a great day in the regiment. It fought in Persia in 1857,
and was particularly distinguished in Central India.

15th (The King's) HUSSARS


The 15th Hussars was the first regiment of Light Dragoons raised for
permanent service in 1759 by Colonel Eliott, the gallant defender of
Gibraltar, afterwards Lord Heathfield. It was named after him "Eliott's
Light Horse." In 1767 the regiment was made "Royal" as a reward for its
services in Germany, and in 1768 styled the "King's Light Dragoons."
Its present title it received in 1806.

This regiment was authorized to bear on its helmets the following
inscription: "Five battalions of Foot defeated and taken by this
regiment, with their colours, and nine pieces of cannon, at Emsdorff,
16th July, 1760." In 1794, the 15th, at Villiers-en-Cauchies, charged
enormously superior numbers of all arms. It succeeded in its object at
a terrible sacrifice. In 1799, the troopers had given them the honour
of decking their helmets with scarlet feathers.

Nicknamed "The Fighting Fifteenth."

16th (The Queen's) LANCERS


The regiment was raised in 1759. It served with distinction throughout
the Peninsular War, from Talavera to Toulouse, during the greater part
of which time it was attached to the Light Division. Subsequently, it
fought at Quatre Bras and at Waterloo, where it lost heavily. It was
the first Lancer regiment to serve in India, and the first British
Lancers to use the lance in action. During a tour of service in India
extending over a quarter of a century it won great fame on many fields.
At the battle of Aliwal (where Sir Harry Smith, with a force of 12,000
men with 32 guns, defeated 19,000 Sikhs with 68 guns) it specially
distinguished itself.

The 16th Lancers, being the only Lancer corps wearing the scarlet
tunic, received the sobriquet of the "Scarlet Lancers."

17th (Duke of Cambridge's Own) LANCERS


The regiment was raised in 1759 and in 1876 received its present title
of "17th (Duke of Cambridge's Own) Lancers." It was present throughout
the Crimean War and fought at the Alma, Inkerman and Balaklava, where
it was one of the five regiments that took part in the famous charge of
the Light Brigade. It also fought in the Indian Mutiny.

Popularly known as the "Death or Glory Boys," and "Skull and
Crossbones," from the circumstance that its Colonel (Hole) chose
its crest of a "death's head" and its motto "_or glory_," as he
wished all to remember General Wolfe, with whom he happened to serve
in the year on which his regiment was first raised in Scotland by
Lord Aberdour. Another nickname given them was that of "Bingham's
Dandies," the uniform being of scarlet with white facings and overalls
and black plume. The late Earl of Lucan, when Lord Bingham, was
Lieutenant-Colonel of the corps, which was in his time remarkable for
the well-fitting uniforms both of the officers and men belonging to it.

18th (Queen Mary's Own) HUSSARS


Originally raised in 1759 by the Marquis of Drogheda, and disbanded in
1821, after brilliant service in the Peninsular War and at Waterloo.
The regiment served in the Maroon War and at San Domingo, 1759-60,
and lost so heavily from war and disease that it returned to England
under the command of the regimental surgeon. At one time the Duke of
Wellington served in the regiment, in command of a troop, before being
transferred to the 33rd Foot as a field officer. The present regiment
was raised at Leeds in 1858, and was permitted to revive the honours,
"Peninsula" and "Waterloo," borne by the old regiment. It wore Lincoln
green busby bags and plumes, and scarlet pouches and sabretaches. Its
present title was conferred in 1910.

19th (Queen Alexandra's Own Royal) HUSSARS


Originally raised in 1759 as the 19th Light Dragoons, and converted
into Hussars in 1807. The present regiment was formed in 1860 out of
the late Hon. East India Company's Bengal European Cavalry. It was
subsequently permitted to assume the honours of the old 19th Dragoons
(Lancers): "Assaye" and "Niagara." It fought with distinction during
the Egyptian War, 1882, Suakin, 1884, and in the Nile Expedition. Sir
John French commenced his military career with the regiment.

Nicknamed the "Dumpies," from the circumstance of the men, originally
taken over from the East India Company's 1st Bengal European Cavalry,
being of diminutive size. The Indian history of the regiment is full
of interest, for much hard service was seen and a good deal of heavy
fighting, especially at Assaye, where, for its distinguished conduct,
the badge of the Elephant was awarded.

20th HUSSARS


The Regiment was originally raised in Ireland in 1789 from the "Light
Troop" of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, and wore a scarlet uniform,
the facings being at first yellow and afterwards black. It is a curious
fact that a detachment of the regiment under Sir Robert Wilson was
present with the Russian Army in their operations against Napoleon
in his famous capture of and return from Moscow in 1812 and in the
subsequent campaign in Germany. The present regiment was raised in
1861 by volunteers from the late Hon. East India Company's 2nd Bengal
European Light Cavalry. It was subsequently permitted to assume the
honours of the old 20th Light Dragoons: "Vimiera" and "Peninsula."
Part of the regiment was employed in the Suakin Expedition, 1885, and
subsequently did good service with the Egyptian Frontier Force in
1885-6.

21st (Empress of India's) LANCERS


Four British Cavalry regiments have in succession been numbered the
21st; the original regiment having been raised in 1760 as the 21st
Light Dragoons, by the famous Marquis of Granby. It was disbanded
in 1763, re-raised in 1779, and again disbanded. In 1794 it again
appeared, and saw a great deal of service abroad, and served in St.
Helena when Napoleon was imprisoned there. The uniform first was
scarlet, and later blue, with pink facings, which was afterwards
changed to black velvet.

Raised in 1858 as the 3rd Bengal European Cavalry. In 1862 it was
transferred to the British establishment, and until 1897 was known as
the 21st Hussars. In that year the title was changed to 21st Lancers,
and in 1898, in recognition of its brilliant services at the battle of
Omdurman, its present Royal title was conferred upon it.

Nickname: "The Grey Lancers."

ROYAL HORSE ARTILLERY


Although the Royal Regiment of Artillery dates back to the reign of
King Henry VIII, the Horse Artillery was first organised in 1793. In
1794 the splendid service rendered by the Horse Batteries at Vaux led
the Duke of York to direct it to march past the whole of the allied
armies at a special parade. The famous Chestnut Troop (now "A" Battery)
did equally good service in North Holland in 1799, and the famous
Rocket Troop was raised for special service in Flanders. The Royal
Horse Artillery have won fame on many hard fought battlefields, notably
at Fuentes d'Onor, in the Peninsular War, where Norman Ramsay charged
with his battery (now "I" Battery) through the enemy's cavalry; and
in South Africa and France where "Q" Battery and "L" Battery won many
Victoria Crosses.

Nicknames: "The Right of the Line," "The Galloping Gunners," and "The
Four-wheeled Hussars."

ROYAL FIELD ARTILLERY


The Royal Regiment of Artillery, as it is now known, was formed in
1716, when two companies were permanently established at Woolwich, but,
prior to that, artillery formed part of the King's Armies as early as
the 15th century. The history of the Artillery is really the history
of the British Army, for very seldom indeed has there been an action
fought by British troops without some representatives of the Royal
Regiment being present. The guns are looked upon as the standards of
the regiment, and in the old days one of the guns was known as the
colour gun, which was usually the heaviest piece in the field. All
ranks are animated with the most intense bravery and devotion, which
has been demonstrated on many fields, and won for the regiment many
distinctions. The Great War on the Continent has added greatly to the
reputation of the regiment.

Nicknamed "The Gunners."

ROYAL GARRISON ARTILLERY


The Garrison, or Heavy Gunners can be considered as the direct
descendants of the ancient British Artillery, which was originally
formed for siege or defence purposes. The more mobile Field and Horse
Artillery was not formed till very many years later. The records of the
Garrison Artillery show they have won glory in all parts of the world.
The gallantry displayed during the two years defence of Gibraltar is
among their most cherished traditions, and for distinguished conduct
at the reduction of Martinique, No. 11 Company received as a mark of
honour a battle axe, which was directed to be carried by the tallest
gunner at the head of the battery when on parade. The splendid
achievements of the Heavy Artillery in the great war with Germany has
added materially to the reputation of the regiment for gallantry and
valour.

CORPS OF ROYAL ENGINEERS


The Corps can trace its history back as a distinct organization to
1717, but Engineers or artificers were known before that. In 1722
the Corps was known as "The Soldier Artificier Corps," and later as
"The Corps of Military Artificers." In 1788, under Master-General the
Duke of Richmond, the Officers were constituted "The Corps of Royal
Engineers," the other ranks being "The Royal Line Artificers." The
title of "The Royal Sappers and Miners" replaced them in 1813, and
for their distinguished service in the Crimea all ranks were united
under the title of "The Corps of Royal Engineers." Of the services,
individual and collective, of the Corps during its history it would be
impossible to treat in detail, for they have served with distinction
in every battle and in all parts of the Empire, and have a glorious
history of unusual valour.

Nicknames: "The Sappers"; "The Mudlarks"; "The Measurers"; and "The
Mounted Bricklayers."

GRENADIER GUARDS


The Grenadier Guards were raised in the year 1657, when the loyal
English who shared King Charles's exile were formed into six regiments,
the first of which was called the "Royal Regiment of Guards."

For the first seventy years of its existence it saw much and varied
service, and won fame on many fields, and also served on board the
fleet. During the Peninsular War its good order and steady discipline
were conspicuous. Its conduct at Waterloo is a matter of history, and
its heroic bearing during the Crimean War is well known.

The title of "Grenadiers" was given to the first Regiment of Foot
Guards in 1815, in recognition of their having defeated the French
Grenadier Guards at Waterloo.

The Grenadier Guards have the nicknames of the "Sand-bags," the
"Coalheavers," and "Old Eyes," and the 3rd Battalion "The Bill Browns."

COLDSTREAM GUARDS


The Coldstream Guards was originally formed from Sir A. Hesselrig's
and Colonel Fenwick's Regiments of Foot, and obtained its title from
Monck's celebrated march from Coldstream in January, 1660, to restore
King Charles II. The regiment was also known as the "Nulli Secundus
Club," and "The Coldstreamers." This is the only regiment of the
Parliamentary Army that was not disbanded at the Restoration in 1660.
Under Marlborough it shared in the great victories of Oudenarde and
Malplaquet, and at many sieges and encounters down to the peace of
1713. It took part in most of the great battles of the Peninsular War.
At Waterloo it was posted on the ridge above Hougoumont, and to it
fell the honour of defending the Chateau of Hougoumont--the key of the
British position--throughout that memorable day, and nobly was that
duty performed. During the Crimean War the regiment fought splendidly,
as it has on every subsequent occasion, and has worthily upheld its
motto of _Nulli Secundus_.

SCOTS GUARDS


The origin of this distinguished corps is uncertain, the regimental
papers having been destroyed by fire in 1841; but it was raised about
1639, and was originally called by the same name it now bears, which,
however, had been for a long time in disuse, and was only in 1877
restored to the corps by the late Queen Victoria. Previously it had
been styled "The Scots Fusilier Guards" and the "3rd Foot Guards."
Throughout its long career it has ever been distinguished for its
valour and discipline. At Namur it advanced without firing a shot, but
exposed to the murderous fire of the enemy from the ramparts, close up
to the palisades, when they poured in their volleys and put the enemy
to confusion. It distinguished itself at Lincelles for its coolness,
steady fire and gallant bayonet charge. During the Peninsular War it
was constantly engaged, and there and at subsequent battles not only
upheld the traditions of the regiment, but gained a reputation no
troops could surpass.

Nicknamed "The Jocks."

IRISH GUARDS


Raised in 1900 by the late Queen Victoria to commemorate the bravery of
the Irish Regiments in the South African War. All ranks have worthily
upheld the high traditions of the Brigade of Guards in their first
campaign, being distinguished for conspicuous bravery in many of the
frequent actions against the overwhelming German forces in France and
Belgium. Many decorations have been won, among them being the Victoria
Cross awarded to Sergeant Michael O'Leary whose great bravery has been
widely extolled among the Allies.

Nicknamed "Bob's Own," from the fact that the late Lord Roberts was the
first Colonel of the regiment.

WELSH GUARDS


This regiment was raised in London in 1915 by the Royal Warrant of
King George V, during the progress of the War with Germany, and the
first Battalion of 1,100 of all ranks, under Lieut.-Col. W. Murray
Threipland, was quickly completed, a second Battalion being then
authorised. Major-General Sir Francis Lloyd was the first Colonel of
the regiment, and Col. Lord Harlech, who commenced his military career
in the Coldstream Guards, was appointed to command the regiment and
the regimental district. His Majesty in authorising the raising of the
regiment directed that the leading company of the 1st Battalion should
be denominated "The Prince of Wales's Company," in the same way as the
leading company of the 1st Grenadier Guards is known as the "King's
Company."

THE ROYAL SCOTS


The Royal Scots have the proud distinction of being the oldest regiment
in the British Army, dating its present existence from 1633. It was
organised by Sir John Hepburn, and on his death 37 years later the
command was given to Lord James Douglas and became known as "Douglas's
Regiment." Nobly has it sustained its reputation, and in every quarter
of the globe, the roll of "Dumbarton's Drums" has been heard.

"Pontius Pilate's Bodyguard" is the extraordinary nickname given to
the regiment. This was on account of a dispute between the regiment
(then the "Regiment de Douglas," or "Douglas Ecossais") when in the
French service, and the Picardy Regiment, as to the antiquity of the
two corps. The Picardy Regiment laid claim to having been on duty on
the night after the Crucifixion. To this the 1st Foot wittily rejoined:
"Had we been on duty, we should not have slept at our post."

THE QUEEN'S (Royal West Surrey Regiment)


The regiment is the oldest English infantry unit, having been raised
in 1661 by the Earl of Peterborough. Nicknamed "Kirke's Lambs," from
its Colonel and badge in 1682. Was raised to garrison Tangier, and
received then the badge of the "Paschal Lamb," the crest of the House
of Braganza. Was known when raised as the "1st Tangerines." The title
"Royal" and motto, _Pristinæ virtutis memor_, was conferred for its
brilliant conduct at Tongres in 1685, where for 28 hours it gallantly
maintained itself against 40,000 of the enemy, and by its heroism saved
the rest of the army from being taken by surprise.

A detachment was on board the "Birkenhead" when that transport was
wrecked, and in order to allow the women and children to be saved,
stood firm in their ranks on the deck of the doomed ship, until the
waves swallowed all but the deathless glory of their deed.

THE BUFFS (East Kent Regiment)


The 3rd Foot (The Buffs) was so called first in 1708. Its previous
title was "The Holland Regiment," having been in the Dutch Service from
the time of Queen Elizabeth. It was raised in 1572 to the number of
3000 men by London Guilds, when the Dutch were in revolt against Spain.
To this circumstance, the regiment owes the time-honoured privilege it
enjoys of marching through the City of London with drums beating and
colours flying without let or hindrance, the custom being derived from
the privileges of the Train Bands of Elizabethan days. It was nicknamed
the "Buff Howards" from the colour of its facings and Colonel's name,
1737 to 1749; also the "Old Buffs," to distinguish it from the 31st
Regiment, which was the "Young Buffs." Other nicknames given were
"The Nutcrackers," on account of its prowess in cracking the heads of
the enemy, and "The Resurrectionists," which was obtained at Albuhera
where the regiment was dispersed by the Polish Lancers, and reappeared
shortly after.

THE KING'S OWN (Royal Lancaster Regiment)


The regiment was raised in 1680 by the Earl of Plymouth. It gained
great distinction at the siege of Namur, 1695, and while serving as
Marines in 1704 it shared in the capture of Gibraltar. It has fought
with distinction in all parts of the world, and has ever acquitted
itself with credit to England and glory to itself. It was one of the
few British regiments to make the famous desert march across Abyssinia,
to the capture of Magdala. It also fought in the Zulu War and was one
of the devoted battalions to climb and capture Spion Kop, holding that
awful position throughout a day of dire disaster with unflinching
courage.

Nicknames: The "Lions," from its ancient badge, the Lion of England,
given to it by the Prince of Orange, the regiment being the first to
join his Standard after landing at Torbay in 1688. "Barrell's Blues,"
from William Barrell, Colonel of the regiment in 1740, and its facings.
The title of "The King's Own" was conferred by George I in 1715.

THE NORTHUMBERLAND FUSILIERS


Raised in 1674 the regiment was in 1764 nicknamed the "Shiners"
from its smart and clean appearance; and whilst in the Peninsula
was called the "Old and Bold," "The Fighting Fifth," and also "Lord
Wellington's Bodyguard." It formed part of a small force which beat off
an overwhelming body of the enemy at El Boden in 1811, a performance
which Wellington notified to the Army as "a memorable example of what
can be done by steadiness, discipline, and confidence." A custom, which
has long prevailed in this regiment, is for all ranks to wear roses
in their caps on St. George's Day. Among the "men" who have served in
the ranks was Phœbe Hassell, the famous female soldier, afterwards
pensioned by George IV, and to whose memory there is a stone in the
churchyard at Hove, Brighton.

THE ROYAL WARWICKSHIRE REGIMENT


The regiment has a very ancient history, having existed for some time
before being brought on the British establishment in 1688. It fought
at Namur in 1695, and in 1707 was one of the regiments cut up at the
fierce battle of Almanza. It won much distinction at the battle of
Saragossa, and Colonel Harrison, who then commanded, was, as a mark of
honour to the regiment, sent home with thirty standards, taken that
day, to lay before the Sovereign. Tradition has it that one was the
standard belonging to a Moorish Regiment in the Spanish pay, bearing an
Antelope, and that that badge was forthwith conferred on the regiment.
It won great fame during the Peninsular War. In the action at Echalar,
2nd August, 1813, its conduct was described by Wellington as "the most
gallant and the finest thing he had ever witnessed." The title "Royal"
was conferred in 1832.

It was nicknamed "Guise's Geese," also "The Warwickshire Lads," and
"The Saucy Sixth."

  Until after the Crimean War there were no 2nd Lieutenants or
  Ensigns in this regiment. The regiment has the privilege of
  marching through the City of London with fixed bayonets, drums
  beating, and colours flying.




THE ROYAL FUSILIERS (City of London Regiment)


Raised in 1685. In the Peninsular War it took a glorious part, and no
troops hazarded their lives more freely for their country's cause,
than the Royal Fusiliers. At Talavera they met the storm of war with
unshaken firmness, and captured seven of the enemy's guns, but the
undying lustre of the glory they won at Albuhera, almost overshadows
their other gallant exploits at this time. They had marched from
Badajos at 2 a.m. the same day, and the night march of 20 miles,
followed by the supreme effort which regained the lost heights of
Albuhera, must rank as an unsurpassed feat of arms. During the Crimean
War the conduct of the Royal Fusiliers won further glory.

It was once known as "The Hanoverian White Horse," and also as the
"Elegant Extracts" from the fact that the officers were selected from
other corps.

THE KING'S (LIVERPOOL REGIMENT)


Raised in 1685. It gained considerable reputation during Marlborough's
campaign when it was known as the "Queen's," but on George I's
accession it became "The King's," a proud title which it still keeps
and by which it is known. It fought at Dettingen in 1743, memorable as
being the last battle in which a British King led his army in person.
It was stationed at Jullundur on the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny. A
detachment of the regiment performed an important service by securing
the fort and magazine at Phillour. They marched from Jullundur to
Delhi, in fourteen days, and with bayonet and rifle helped to clear
the city of the mutineers. They took part in the relief of Agra, where
they defeated 8,000 mutineers and captured all their guns. They then
proceeded to the relief of Lucknow and took part in other operations.

THE NORFOLK REGIMENT


Formed in 1695. The "Figure of Britannia" was awarded as a regimental
badge to commemorate its heroic struggle against overwhelming numbers
at the battle of Almanza. It won much glory during the Peninsular War.
At Roleia it bore the brunt of the enemy's attack, and at Corunna,
where the gallant Sir John Moore met a soldier's death, to the regiment
fell the melancholy honour of placing him in a soldier's grave. In
the Afghan War of 1842, and in the Sikh War of 1845 its bravery was
conspicuous. At Ferozeshah the Sikhs had 100 guns, which they served
with great effect, repulsing the first attack; but the Ninth restored
the day, bayoneting the Sikhs at their guns, and driving the enemy
before them.

Nicknames: "The Holy Boys," a name given them by the Spanish during the
Peninsular War, from the fact that they wore the figure of Britannia
on their cross-belts, which the Spaniards took to represent the Virgin
Mary; also "The Fighting Ninth," and "The Norfolk Howards."

THE LINCOLNSHIRE REGIMENT


Formed from an Independent Company in 1685. It fought with distinction
during Marlborough's campaign. Of its conduct in the Sikh War the
Brigadier said, "The glorious conduct of the regiment at Sobraon is
beyond any praise I could give--it was the corner stone of the victory."

During the Indian Mutiny it assisted to save Benares and Dinapore from
the Sepoys and to bring the final rescue to the heroic defenders of
Lucknow. The regiment took part in the famous march on Khartoum and in
the battle of Atbara and Omdurman which broke the power of the Mahdi
and placed Soudan under British control. It was also in the South
African War, and again added to its fine reputation.

It was (with the 62nd) nicknamed "The Springers," during the American
War, from their readiness for action. "The Poachers" in allusion to the
famous old ballad, which is played as the Regimental March.

  The Regimental March owes its origin to a circumstance prior to
  the Battle of Salamanca. The 11th found itself marching in close
  proximity to a French regiment. As no order to attack was given,
  the officers on either side saluted by lowering their swords, and
  at parting the British bandsmen struck up, out of compliment to
  their adversaries, the tune in question.




THE DEVONSHIRE REGIMENT


Formed in 1685. It displayed splendid bravery but was cut to pieces at
Almanza in 1707. During the Peninsular War it gained great distinction.
At Salamanca, the fierce character of the struggle may be gathered from
the fact that only four officers and sixty-seven men of the regiment
could be mustered at the close of the action, to hear, however, words
of praise seldom addressed to an individual regiment. At Toulouse for
the second time during the war it shared in the supreme effort which
turned the tide of victory. No record of the Devons would be complete
which omitted the supreme gallantry of the regiment in the desperate
fighting at Wagon Hill during the South African War.

Nickname: "The Bloody Eleventh," from the number of casualties at the
battle of Salamanca.

THE SUFFOLK REGIMENT


Formed in 1685. At Dettingen, under King George II, it took part in
the final charge which assured the victory--the last occasion on which
a British King personally commanded his troops in action. It was one
of the six British Infantry regiments which at Minden shattered the
French cavalry, and finally drove out of the field every body of troops
opposed to them. The Duke of Brunswick who commanded the forces said:
"It was here the British Infantry gained immortal glory." Its services
in the defence of Gibraltar are commemorated by the Castle and Key and
Motto. At the storming of Seringapatam it captured eight stands of
colours. For this splendid behaviour during their two years' defence of
Gibraltar was given the crest and motto they now wear.

Nickname: The "Old Dozen." The men wear roses in their caps on August
1st in commemoration of the Battle of Minden, 1759.

PRINCE ALBERT'S (Somerset Light Infantry)


Raised in 1685. While fighting in Spain, 1706-13, the regiment fought
as dragoons. It earned a brilliant record in Afghanistan, 1839-42.
After storming Ghuznee it was ordered to Jellalabad which detached
post it gallantly held. The massacre of the Cabul force inspired the
Afghans to fiercer efforts against Jellalabad; but in spite of news
of disaster, the enemy, and even nature itself,--for over 100 shocks
of earthquake shook the ruined walls--the brave Somersets defied them
all. At length they sallied out and decisively defeated the Afghans.
This "Illustrious Garrison," as it was termed by the Government of
India, was received on its return by special honours in all cantonments
through which it passed. For its services it received its present
title, and a mural crown superscribed "Jellalabad."

Nicknamed "The Bleeders."

THE PRINCE OF WALES'S OWN (West Yorkshire Regiment)


Raised in 1685. It shared in the defence of Gibraltar in 1727, and
added very considerably to its laurels in the wars of 1793-4. In an
attack on the French camp at Famars, 23rd May, 1793, it not only
gained a victory, but also its regimental march. Among the pieces of
music which fanned the fiery zeal of the French was "Ça ira," to the
strains of which they hurled themselves with impetuosity on the British
troops. The colonel however, with a magnificent inspiration called
out to his men "Come along, my lads, we'll break them to their own
d----d tune," and bade his drummers strike up "Ça ira." The effect was
irresistible, and the French found themselves flying from the sound of
their own martial air. The regiment fought with characteristic bravery
at Corunna, in Java, at Waterloo, in India, in the Crimea, New Zealand,
and South Africa, reaping the highest commendation for gallantry and
devotion everywhere.

Nicknames: "The Old and Bold" and "Calvert's Entire."

EAST YORKSHIRE REGIMENT


Raised in 1685. The regiment went to Holland with Marlborough, and
bore a distinguished part in all his campaigns. It was one of the five
regiments which commenced the battle of Blenheim by an attack on the
entrenched village of that name, moving up steadily under a withering
fire without returning a shot, until their leader, General Rowe, struck
his sword into the palisades. It fought at Ramillies, at Oudenarde, and
at Malplaquet, and bore an active part at Tournay. It went to Quebec
with Wolfe, who specially commended the steadiness of the regiment. It
fought in the great battle on the heights of Abraham, and after Wolfe's
fall served in the conquest of Canada. Has a splendid record of bravery
in many other battles.

Nicknames: "The Snappers," from an incident in the American War, where,
the ammunition having given out, they continued to snap their firelocks
with undaunted determination. The enemy retired, misled by their aspect
and bravery; also called the "Poona Guards."

BEDFORDSHIRE REGIMENT


Raised in 1688. It served all through Marlborough's campaigns, and its
gallant conduct in no less than thirty-four successful battles and
sieges firmly established its reputation. It was at the siege of Lille,
where one of the sergeants, Littler, performed gallant service by
swimming the river with a hatchet, and, in the face of the enemy single
handed cut the fastenings of a drawbridge. It took part in the battle
of Dettingen, where the French generously commended their bravery, and
declared they saw them advancing, not like men, but devils, in the
face of whole batteries, which fired directly into them, sweeping down
all ranks without being able to break them. As part of the Chitral
Relief Expedition it took part in the storming of the Malakand Pass.
This expedition was an example of sturdy perseverance in the face of
obstacles, which it is not possible for those who have not served on
the Northern Frontier of India to realise.

Nicknames: "The Old Bucks"; also known as "The Peacemakers," from the
ferocity with which it was wont to attack the enemy, who were generally
glad to quickly make peace.

LEICESTERSHIRE REGIMENT


Raised in 1688. It took part in the earlier portion of Marlborough's
campaigns and then proceeded to Spain, where it fought at the battle of
Almanza with desperate courage against overwhelming numbers. It also
took part in the conquest of Canada. In 1804 it proceeded to India,
where, during a period of 18 years, it took a distinguished part in
building up our mighty Indian Empire. Its services were specially
acknowledged by the grant of the badge of the "Royal Tiger" with the
word "Hindoostan," as a lasting testimony of the exemplary conduct of
all ranks during its service in India from 1804 to 1823. In 1838 it was
with the army which forced its way through Scinde capturing Hyderabad
and Kurrachee.

Nicknames: "Lily Whites," from their facings; also "Bengal Tigers,"
from its badge, a Royal Tiger.

THE ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT


Raised in 1683. After serving afloat as Marines it went to Flanders,
where its splendid valour at the assault on the Castle of Namur on 20th
August, 1695, won for it the admiration of the whole of the Allied
army. This gallant feat, performed under the eyes of the King, won for
the regiment the distinguished title of the Royal Regiment of Foot of
Ireland, and the King conferred upon it the right of displaying the
badge of the harp and crown, and that of the lion of Nassau, with the
motto "Virtutis Namurcensis Præmium." Was one of the Irish Regiments
which fought so gallantly in South Africa and to whose bravery the
Irish Guards were raised in commemoration. "The Royal Irish" is the
only one now in existence out of nineteen regiments raised in Ireland
from independent companies of musketeers and pikemen.

ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS OF WALES'S OWN (Yorkshire Regiment)


Raised in 1688. Its first services were in Flanders, where it
fought at the siege and capture of Namur. It took part in the most
sanguinary of Marlborough's victories, the battle of Malplaquet,
besides engaging in several of the sieges which constituted the latter
part of the campaign. The massacre in Ceylon of a detachment of the
regiment, consisting of 178 officers and men, forms one of the most
tragic episodes in military history. The remainder of the regiment
was speedily in the field to avenge those slaughtered, and an ample
retribution was exacted from the treacherous Candyans. During the
Crimean war it nobly upheld its reputation, and the regiment fought
with splendid bravery in the Tirah campaign, and in South Africa, being
present at the relief of Kimberley, and the battle of Paardeberg. It
added to its great name in the great war on the Continent.

Nickname: "The Green Howards," from its facings, and the name of its
first Colonel.

THE LANCASHIRE FUSILIERS


Raised in 1688. It won lasting fame on the historic field of Minden.
So heavy were its losses on that day that Prince Ferdinand directed
the regiment to be excused from further duty. This they declined to
accept, and a General Order records that "Kingsley's Regiment, at its
own request, will resume its portion of duty in the line." In addition
to the battle honour a laurel wreath was ordered to be worn on the
colours and appointments. These glorious memories are recalled by the
regimental custom of wearing "Minden Roses" in the caps on each 1st
August. Its bravery throughout the Peninsular War was conspicuous, and
the Duke of Wellington, when presenting it with Colours in 1838, said:
"I declare that of the many distinguished regiments of the British
Army, which I have had the honour to command, this, the best and most
distinguished, is entitled to all the eulogiums I may have bestowed
upon it."

Nicknames: The "Two Tens" from its number, also "The Minden Boys," and
"Kingsley's Stand."

THE ROYAL SCOTS FUSILIERS


Raised in 1678. It was one of the brave battalions which steadily
marched to the attack on the village of Blenheim until the palisades
were reached, without firing a shot in reply to the tempest of shot
which greeted them. At Ramillies, at Oudenarde, on the red field of
Malplaquet, the most fiercely fought of Marlborough's victories, and
in numerous minor engagements, its conduct was ever conspicuous. Under
the brave "Sheriff" Agnew,--the Sir Andrew Agnew whose name is familiar
to readers of Scott,--it fought at Dettingen. The regiment delivered a
volley, and charged the cavalry with the bayonet, nearly annihilating
a French corps. King George II. witnessed the movement and its result,
and praised all ranks for their great gallantry. The regiment has
fought in all parts of the world since, and with equal distinction.

Nicknamed: "Earl of Mar's Grey Breeks," from the colour of the men's
breeches at the time the regiment was raised (1678).

THE CHESHIRE REGIMENT


Raised in 1689, and was present at the battle of Dettingen, where
King George II. commanded in person. The King was at one time hotly
pressed by the French cavalry, when a detachment formed round him
under an oak tree and drove the enemy away. The King plucked a leaf
off the tree and, handing it to the commander, desired the regiment
to wear it in memory of their gallant conduct. The oakleaf is now
worn in the head-dress, and on the colours on September 12th, and on
ceremonial parades. In 1795 it recruited its ranks with poorhouse boys
between the ages of twelve and sixteen. Amongst the boys who joined
was John Shipp, an orphan, who performed the unique feat of _twice_
winning a commission from the ranks before he was thirty years old, for
conspicuous bravery in the field. In 1843 it formed part of the force
under Sir Charles Napier which destroyed the Indian desert stronghold
of Emaun Ghur--an enterprise characterised as one of the most curious
and dangerous military feats ever known.

Nicknames: The "Two Twos"; also in 1795 the "Red Knights," from
being served out with all red clothing; also known as the "Lightning
Conductors."

THE ROYAL WELSH FUSILIERS


Raised in 1689. In the Crimean War, at Alma it captured a Russian gun,
which is now at the Depot, Wrexham. It was during this action that
Sergeant Luke O'Connor gained his Victoria Cross and a commission, and
lived to attain the rank of General. The regiment has fought in all
parts of the world and has a splendid roll of battle honours.

Nicknamed "The Nanny Goats" and "The Royal Goats," from its custom
of having a goat led at the head of the drums. Regimental custom
prescribes that on St. David's night, the 1st of March, every officer
or guest who has never eaten a leek before, shall eat one, standing
in his chair with one foot on the table, while a drummer beats a roll
behind him.

  appreciation of the gallant defence of Rorke's Drift, 1879.




THE SOUTH WALES BORDERERS


Raised in 1689, the regiment has one of the most remarkable histories
in the British Army, having twice being almost annihilated, at
Chillianwallah, 1849, where 23 officers and 527 men were killed and
wounded, the regiment being brought out of action by the quartermaster;
and in 1879 at Isandlwana, where hardly a man escaped death. The
gallant defence of Rorke's Drift by one company roused the wonder and
admiration of the whole civilised world. The losses of the regiment in
killed alone reached the appalling total of 21 officers and 590 men. It
had the proud distinction of having won more Victoria Crosses than any
other corps in the British Army.

Nicknamed "Howard's Greens," from its facings and its Colonel's name
from 1717 to 1737.

THE KING'S OWN SCOTTISH BORDERERS


Raised in 1689, in the space of four hours, by the Earl of Leven, in
Edinburgh. At the siege of Namur, one of the strongest fortresses in
Europe, it lost 20 officers and 500 men by the explosion of one of the
enemy's mines. The Borderers, however, quickly recovered and routed the
enemy at the point of the bayonet. The regiment was also one of the
gallant six to participate in the glorious victory at Minden. Acting as
Marines it participated in Lord Howe's glorious victory of 1st June,
1794. It has also fought with great credit in other parts of the world.

They were sometimes called "The Botherers," and commonly "K.O.S.B's."
Also nicknamed the "Kokky-Olly Birds." This regiment has the exclusive
privilege of beating up for recruits in the streets of Edinburgh at any
time without asking the leave of the Lord Provost.

THE CAMERONIANS (SCOTTISH RIFLES)


The Cameronians date from the revolution of 1688, twenty companies
of sixty men being raised within the space of 24 hours. Proceeding
to Flanders it fought bravely and with much distinction during
Marlborough's campaigns. It was engaged in the capture of Martinique
and Guadaloupe, where among other trophies of victory it took an
"Eagle," the regimental standard of the French. It bore a distinguished
part in the Crimean War. It also took part in the hottest fighting in
the Mutiny and in the march through Abyssinia, and fought with great
gallantry in the Zulu and South African campaigns. Two of our most
distinguished Field-Marshals--Lord Wolseley, V.C., and Sir Evelyn Wood,
V.C., served in this regiment.

Nicknames: 1st Battalion "The Cameronians," and the 2nd Battalion
"Perthshire Grey Breeks," from the colour of the men's breeches.

THE ROYAL INNISKILLING FUSILIERS


Formed in 1689. Proceeding to the West Indies it greatly distinguished
itself at the storming and capture of the citadel of St. Lucia. In
recognition of "the steady and intrepid bearing of the officers and men
of the regiment," Sir Ralph Abercromby directed that the garrison on
marching out should lay down their arms to the Inniskillings. During
the Peninsular War, at Castella, a French officer advancing in front
of the line, challenged anyone in the regiment to single combat. His
wish was immediately complied with by Captain Waldron, who after a
few passes, laid the Frenchman dead. The Inniskillings then dashed
forward with the bayonet, and the enemy broke and fled before their
irresistible onslaught. The regiment has reaped honour and glory in all
parts of the world.

The 2nd Battalion were nicknamed "The Lumps."

GLOUCESTERSHIRE REGIMENT


Raised in 1694, and has fought with the highest credit in all parts
of the Empire, during which it has won several peculiar and highly
cherished distinctions. Of its conduct at Chillianwallah the Duke of
Wellington said, "the 61st were mainly instrumental in gaining the
victory."

The 28th Regiment was nicknamed "The Old Braggs" in 1750, from its
Colonel's name, General Philip Braggs. Also the "Slashers," from
their gallantry at the battle of the White Plains, and passage of the
Brunx river in 1777. A badge is worn on the back of the head-dress by
both battalions of this regiment, given for the bravery of the 28th
at Alexandria in 1801. They were attacked by French cavalry while in
line, and there being no time to form square, the Colonel ordered the
rear rank to "Right about face," and they succeeded in beating off the
enemy, 7,000 in number.

Nickname: 1st Battalion "The Back Numbers."

WORCESTERSHIRE REGIMENT


The regiment was raised in 1694 and won in action one of the proudest
mottoes ever bestowed on a regiment, that of "Firm." The 29th was the
last of the regiments in the Peninsula to retain the queue, in which
the men fought at Vimiera, the officers wearing the old fashioned and
picturesque cocked hats.

Nicknames: "The Ever-sworded 29th" owing to a peculiar custom, which
demands that the captain and subaltern of the day shall dine with
their swords on. Up to the fifties all the officers sat down to dinner
wearing their weapons, the custom having originated in 1746, when a
part of the regiment, stationed at the Leeward Islands, was surprised
without its arms, and treacherously murdered by the Indians. The "Vein
Openers," given on account of its being the first to draw blood,
in 1770, when the disturbances, which preceded the outbreak of the
American War, commenced. They are also known as the "Old and Bold,"
"The Star of the Line," and "The Saucy Greens."

EAST LANCASHIRE REGIMENT


Raised in 1694. When first formed it saw much eventful service as
Marines, and served in the capture of Gibraltar in 1704, and in
the great sea-fight off Malaga which followed. In January 1816, a
battalion of the 59th was wrecked while proceeding to Ireland, and
nearly the whole of the men perished. At Waterloo, after the British
squares reformed line to make the final advance, the regiment left its
formation plainly marked on the ground it had occupied by the square
of dead and dying comrades who had fallen in the grim opposition to
the enemy's cavalry and artillery. It fought with great distinction in
the Crimea, China, Afghanistan and South Africa, winning the highest
commendations everywhere.

Nicknamed: "The Triple Xs," also "The Three Tens." 59th Foot, "Lily
Whites," from its facings.

THE EAST SURREY REGIMENT


Raised in 1702 as a corps of Marines and for many years did splendid
service ashore and afloat all over the world. The burning of the
"Kent," East Indiaman, with a wing of the 31st Regiment on board, in
the Bay of Biscay, on 1st May, 1824, forms one of the most thrilling
episodes of heroism at sea British regimental history affords. During a
storm the vessel caught fire and was totally destroyed. The discipline
of the men under these terrible circumstances was beyond all praise,
and in a great measure owing to this fact over 550 people out of 637
were saved. In the Sikh War they captured four standards.

Nicknames: The 1st Battalion (31st Foot) was known as "The Young
Buffs," to distinguish it from the 3rd (Old Buffs). The 2nd Battalion
(70th Foot) was nicknamed the "Glasgow Greys."

THE DUKE OF CORNWALL'S LIGHT INFANTRY


Raised in 1702. In its early history it saw much varied service as
Marines. The 2nd Battalion (46th Foot) in 1777 was called the "Red
Feathers," from the following circumstances. The light company took
part in an attack against General Wayne's Brigade, near Brandywine
Creek, in which the Americans were surprised and utterly defeated. The
Americans vowed vengeance and swore that they would give no quarter;
the soldiers of the light company stained their feathers red as a
distinguishing mark, so that the enemy could easily see whom to attack.
This badge is still preserved in the brass feather and red cloth of the
helmet and cap badge. They are also called "The Lacedemonians." The
heroic defence of the Lucknow Residency, and the tragic fate of the
detachment under Captain Moore, at Cawnpore, are treasured memories.
The 46th are also known as "Murray's Bucks," "The Surprisers," and "The
Doc's" (from the initials).

THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON'S REGIMENT (West Riding)


Raised in 1702 as the 33rd Foot, and in 1814 nicknamed "The Havercake
Lads," its recruiting sergeants preceding the recruits with a haver
or oatcake stuck on their swords. From its earliest days the regiment
was distinguished for bravery in the field, being commended in 1705-6
at the storming of Valentia d'Alcantara, and nearly annihilated at
the battle of Almanza in 1707. The same bravery has marked it through
the centuries, and to-day it is showing that its ancient courage is
maintained undiminished. The Duke of Wellington served in it and
afterwards commanded it, and the regiment was named after him.

The 2nd Battalion (76th Foot) became known in 1806 as "The Old
Immortals," most of its men having been wounded or died in the ten
or twelve years previously; "The Old Seven-and-Sixpennies," from its
number; "The Hindoostan Regiment."

THE BORDER REGIMENT


Raised in 1702. During the Peninsular War, at Arroyo dos Molinos it
performed one of the most brilliant feats of the whole war; single
handed the battalion cut off and made prisoners many French officers
of distinction, besides an entire battalion of the French 34th of the
Line, the brass drums and drum-major's staff of which are still in
possession of the 1st Battalion. The 1st Battalion (34th Foot) was
one of the "boy regiments" reformed in 1797 and sent to the Cape to
be acclimatised. The 2nd Battalion (55th Foot) are known as "The Two
Fives," from their number. The "Dragon" badge commemorates the services
of the 55th in China, and it had the unique distinction for many years
of wearing the red and white feather in their chacos, with red on
top. Both battalions met in the Crimea, and did fine service before
Sevastopol.

Nickname: "The Cattle Reeves," from the old traditions of the Scottish
Border.

THE ROYAL SUSSEX REGIMENT


Raised in 1701. At Quebec, in 1759, in combat with the Grenadiers of
the famous French regiment of Royal Rousillon, it won the tall white
feather which was a distinguishing mark of the 35th until 1810. It is
now commemorated in the Regimental Badge. It took part in the capture
of Malta, where after the successful assault on Fort Ricasoli, the
last post held by the French garrison, the King's Colour of the 35th
was the first flag hoisted over the old stronghold of the Knights,
destined thenceforward as an outpost of the British Empire. The 1st
Battalion (35th Foot) was named "The Orange Lilies," from the colour
of its facings, which it received as a mark of special favour from
King William III. in 1701. It was called on its formation at Belfast
"The Belfast Regiment," and afterwards "The Prince of Orange's Own
Regiment," but its orange facings were relinquished and changed to blue
in 1832, on the corps proceeding to Ireland. The 2nd Battalion (107th
Foot) was raised in 1760 as the Queen's Own Royal British Volunteers.

THE HAMPSHIRE REGIMENT


Raised in 1702, and within a year was in Holland, and bore a gallant
part in Marlborough's campaigns. Few regiments can show a more eventful
record of service during the whole of its career, and it has won fame
in all parts of the world. The 37th is one of the six British infantry
regiments which fought at the battle of Minden, 1st August, 1759; still
commemorated in the regiment by the wearing of roses on the anniversary.

The 2nd Battalion (67th Foot) was raised in 1756 and after arduous
service in the West Indies, the Peninsula, and elsewhere it went to
India, where it served for twenty-one years and bore a distinguished
part in the capture, after a siege of eleven days, of the fortress of
Asseerghur, regarded as the Gibraltar of the East. For its gallantry in
India the crest of the Royal Tiger was bestowed. In subsequent service
in the East the 67th took part in the attack on the Taku Forts, where
four Victoria Crosses were won by Hampshire men.

THE SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE REGIMENT


Raised in 1702. In 1706, the 38th embarked for the West Indies, where
it remained for nearly sixty years, most of the time in the island of
Antigua. When the trouble arose in America, the 38th was one of the
first regiments to be despatched thither and fought at Bunker's Hill.
In 1805 it landed in South Africa and helped to re-capture the Cape of
Good Hope from the Dutch. The 2nd Battalion has been shipwrecked no
less than three times. On the first occasion when proceeding to take
part in Abercromby's campaign in Egypt, when the mess-plate and all
the regimental records were lost; again when returning to India on
completion of the campaign; and again when proceeding to India from
Australia in 1844. Lord Wolseley commenced his distinguished career
in this regiment. The 1st Battalion (38th Foot) was called the "Pump
and Tortoise," and the 2nd Battalion (80th Foot), the "Staffordshire
Knots," and previously "The Staffordshire Volunteers."

THE DORSETSHIRE REGIMENT


Raised in 1702, and was soon afterwards in action. The regiment was
called "Sankey's Horse," because at the battle of Almanza, 1707, the
men were mounted on mules to enable them to arrive in time for the
battle. It was the first King's regiment landed in India in 1754, hence
its proud legend "_Primus in Indis_." In 1742, from its "sad green"
facings, it was christened the "Green Linnets."

The 2nd Battalion (54th Foot) was specially commended by the
Commander-in-Chief for its remarkable gallantry and resolution when
on board the "Sarah Sands" when that vessel took fire at sea having a
large quantity of ammunition on board.

The 2nd Battalion derived the name of "Flamers" in 1781, from the part
they took in destroying twelve privateers, and the town and stores of
New London (U.S.), by fire. It also won for the regiment the proud
crest of the Sphinx and the honour "Marabout" by great gallantry in
Egypt in 1801.

PRINCE OF WALES'S VOLUNTEERS (South Lancashire Regiment)


The regiment (1st Battalion is the old 40th Foot) was raised in
1717, being formed from certain companies of infantry which for many
years had been on duty in the West Indies, and remained for some 46
years longer in the West Indies and America, taking part in most of
the historical military operations in that wonderful continent. On
returning home the regiment was quickly on active service again on the
Continent and in Egypt, and then had another spell of hard service in
America, returning just in time to join Wellington's Army on the eve of
Waterloo where they lost 25 killed and 142 wounded. The 1st Battalion
has the proud distinction of being one of the three regiments which
served uninterruptedly throughout the Peninsular War from 1808-1814.
The 40th Foot was nicknamed "The Excellers," from its number XL., also
"The Fighting Fortieth."

THE WELSH REGIMENT


The 1st Battalion (41st Foot) was raised as a regiment of invalids in
1719, and it was for a long time known as the "1st Invalids," and as
such appears in most of the old "Army Lists." In the era of George II.,
it distinguished itself in Germany.

The 2nd Battalion (the 69th Regiment) was known as "The Old
Agamemnons," so called by Lord Nelson at the naval battle of St.
Vincent, from the name of his ship, the "Agamemnon," on which the
regiment served as Marines; also the "Ups and Downs" from the fact that
their number can be read either way up.

The regiment has fought with the greatest distinction in many quarters
of the world. The curious military arrangements which opened the door
for abuse in bygone days are seen in the fact that Colonel Sir Henry
Walton, K.C.B., who afterwards commanded the 23rd Regiment, received a
commission on the day he was born, through the influence of his father,
and at the age of four was gazetted Ensign in the 41st Foot on full
pay, and at the age of thirteen was posted to the command of a company.

Nickname: "Wardour's Horse."

THE BLACK WATCH (Royal Highlanders)


The 1st Battalion (42nd Foot) was raised in 1730 from six independent
companies of Highlanders for the protection of Edinburgh, as a
regiment of the watch. In 1751, it was numbered the 42nd. On becoming
amalgamated, the bright colours in the tartans were extracted, leaving
only the dark green ground as a tartan, and from this circumstance rose
the title "The Black Watch." In 1794, for gallant conduct at the battle
of Guildermalsen, in Holland, it won the "red hackle" (or plume) which
is worn in the men's feather bonnets.

Known as the "Forty-Twas."

THE OXFORDSHIRE & BUCKINGHAMSHIRE LIGHT INFANTRY


Raised in 1741 and was dispatched almost at once on active service,
serving at Minorca, Canada (taking part in the capture of Quebec),
Martinique, and Havannah. The 43rd and 52nd, with the Rifle Brigade,
made up the famous Light Infantry Brigade trained by Sir John Moore
at Shorncliffe, and so laid the foundation for many famous victories
in the Peninsula. The splendid service rendered by the Light Infantry
in subsequent years is a matter of history. The regiment was so often
chosen for leading the storming parties, that a badge "V.S." (Valiant
Stormer) was granted to the men.

Nicknamed "The Light Bobs," a term that was applied generally to Light
Infantry regiments.

THE ESSEX REGIMENT


Raised in 1749 and during its long and eventful career has added
lustre to the glory of the British Army. The 44th was the only British
infantry regiment in Cabul, in the ill-fated 1841 campaign, and with
all the native troops perished while attempting to reach Jellalabad.
The story of the heroism of all ranks in that great disaster is a proud
tradition in the regiment. The 1st Battalion (44th Foot) was known as
the "Two Fours" from its number, also "The Little Fighting Fours." The
2nd Battalion (56th Foot) was nicknamed "The Pompadours," from the
circumstance that, in 1755, when the regiment was raised, its facings
were a crimson or puce colour, called in those days, Pompadour, after
the notorious French lady who patronised it. It formed part of the
gallant garrison of Gibraltar who successfully withstood the ten years'
siege by the French and Spanish forces.

  band playing "The Young May Moon," which the Colonel thereafter
  adopted as the regimented march.




THE SHERWOOD FORESTERS (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regt.)


Raised in 1741, the regiment has rendered loyal service to King and
country in all parts of the Empire, and has on more than one occasion
received the thanks of General officers for their very fine fighting
qualities. The 1st Battalion has the proud distinction of being one
of the three regiments which served uninterruptedly throughout the
Peninsular War from 1808 to 1814.

The 1st Battalion (45th Foot) was known as "The Old Stubborns" from
their splendid bravery at the battle of Talavera, and "Sherwood
Foresters," in reference to the traditions of the county of Nottingham.
They claim descent from Robin Hood and his merry men.

THE LOYAL NORTH LANCASHIRE REGIMENT


This, the only Regular Infantry in the Army entitled to the word
"Loyal" as part of their proud title, was raised in 1740 in Scotland,
and was with Sir John Cope at Falkirk, and helped to defend Edinburgh
Castle against the rebels in 1745. It afterwards went to America, was
at the capture of Quebec, the capture of Martinique, and many other
famous actions. The 2nd Battalion has added its quota to the splendid
record standing to the credit of the Regiment, its work during the
Indian Mutiny being specially brilliant.

The 1st Battalion (47th Foot) was nicknamed "The Cauliflowers," from
their facings, and "The Lancashire Lads." It was known at Quebec as
"Wolfe's Own," and wears a black line in the lace as an expression of
sorrow for his death.

The 2nd Battalion (81st Foot) possessed a highly-prized title in that
of the "Loyal Lincoln Volunteers."

THE NORTHAMPTONSHIRE REGIMENT


The two Battalions were raised in 1740 and 1755, and were brought
together quite early in their careers, fighting side by side at
Louisburg, at Quebec, and again at Salamanca, Vittoria, and in the
Pyrenees. The regiment has seen active service in many parts of the
world, and it is stated was the first to realise the value of modern
musketry, through the bitter experience gained in the first Boer War.
So impressed was the commanding officer by the terrible casualties
suffered at the hands of the Boer marksmen, that he vowed he would make
his battalion the best shooting unit in the Army, and after the war
succeeded in so doing.

Nicknamed "The Steelbacks," so called from the unflinching manner in
which the men took their floggings; also called "The Black Cuffs."

PRINCESS CHARLOTTE OF WALES'S (Royal Berkshire Regiment)


The 1st Battalion (49th Foot) was raised in 1714, and had nearly eighty
years West Indian and American service. On returning, the regiment
was employed in subduing the mutiny in the Navy at the Nore, and
then as Marines took part in the naval battle of Copenhagen. In 1803
the regiment again went to America, taking part in the operations
against the United States. Active service in South Africa, China, and
the Crimea added further to the good name of the regiment, the title
"Royal" being bestowed for conspicuous gallantry at the action of
Tofrek in the Sudan in 1885. The 2nd Battalion (66th Foot) was raised
in 1755, and has an equally glorious record, being in 1814-16 reputed
to be the finest and best disciplined regiment in Bengal. In the Afghan
War the regiment fought at Maiwand, where their heroic stand, while
suffering fearful losses, is remembered with pride in the Army.

The regiment is sometimes referred to as "The Biscuit Boys" on account
of their depot being at Reading.

THE QUEEN'S OWN (Royal West Kent Regiment)


Raised in 1755, and given black facings, which were retained till the
"Royal" title was bestowed in 1831. No regiment has a more honourable
record of service. The brunt of the battle of Corunna fell on the 50th,
whom Sir John Moore congratulated during the battle, calling out "Well
done, 50th! well done!"

Nicknames: "The Blind Half-Hundred," and "The Dirty Half-Hundred," from
the men in action and in "_sweating_" weather wiping their faces with
their black cuffs; also "The Devil's Royals." During the war in Spain,
at the battle of Vimiera, 1807, the 50th completely routed the enemy,
and received the title of "The Gallant Fiftieth."

The 2nd Battalion (97th Foot) nicknamed "The Celestials," from its
former sky-blue facings.

The 1st Battalion (51st Foot) was raised in 1756 and was "Yorkshire"
from its birth, being intimately connected with the West Riding. It
performed gallant service in all parts of the world, reaping with
the 2nd Battalion (105th Foot), raised in 1839, a rich harvest of
"honours," all of which, however, do not figure on the colours. Sir
John Moore served as an ensign and a field officer in the regiment,
and it came under his command in the famous retreat to Corunna, during
which the Light Division rendered signal service in the rear guard. The
2nd Battalion was originally a regiment in the pay of the East India
Company, and came to England for the first time in 1874.

Nickname: The "Kolis," that word being formed of the initial letters
of the words which composed their regimental title--King's Own Light
Infantry.

THE KING'S (Shropshire Light Infantry)


Raised in 1755. This regiment is the only one to bear the honour
"Nieuport," on its colours, winning this in 1793 by gallantly defending
that town against a surprise attack by the enemy. At Tournay the
regiment, with the 14th and 37th, by a forced march reached the
battlefield at a most opportune moment and decided the day in favour of
the British. The regiment was in St. Helena during the time Napoleon
was held captive there, and that great soldier spoke frequently in
tones of high praise of its conduct. It has maintained that good name
throughout its subsequent career.

Nicknames: The 1st Battalion (53rd Foot)--"The Brickdusts," from their
facings, which were red at one time; also "Old Five and Threepennies,"
from its number. The 2nd Battalion (85th Foot)--"Elegant Extracts," it
being reformed with officers picked from other regiments.

THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE'S OWN (Middlesex Regiment)


Raised in 1755 chiefly of Londoners from the Middlesex Militia, and
nicknamed the "Steelbacks," from being frequently flogged by the
provost. From their extraordinary fighting propensities at Albuhera,
they earned the more honourable and famous name of the "Die-Hards." In
this action, out of 25 officers, they had 22 killed and wounded; of 570
rank and file, killed and wounded 425. The King's colour was riddled
by thirty bullets; Inglis, the heroic colonel, cried out frequently:
"Die hard, my men, die hard," and from that day the gallant 57th
were recognised in camp and barrack as the "Die-Hards." At Inkerman
the officer commanding the 57th inspired his followers at a critical
moment by the thrilling words, "Die-hards, remember Albuhera." The 2nd
Battalion (77th Foot) was called "The Pot-hooks," from the figure 7,
and was one of the three regiments which stormed the breach at Ciudad
Rodrigo.

The regiment was raised in New York in 1755. The uniform was scarlet
with blue facings. It became the first green-coated rifle regiment in
1797, having scarlet facings and black leathern helmets. The roll of
honour shows how well the regiment has served in all the subsequent
campaigns, and it has a reputation for bravery and discipline second to
none in the Army.

Nicknames: "The Greenjackets," from the colour of the uniform; "The
Jaegers"; "The 60th Rifles"; and quite recently has been jocularly
dubbed "The Kaiser's Own" from the fact that the regimental badge, a
Maltese Cross, closely resembles the Iron Cross.

THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH'S (Wiltshire Regiment)


The 1st Battalion (62nd Foot) was raised in 1756 as the 2nd Battalion
of the King's Own, and was soon afterwards formed as a separate corps.
It quickly gained a name for itself when four companies made a gallant
stand among the ruins of Carrick Fergus Castle against a thousand
French troops with artillery, the 62nd maintaining their defence
with bricks and stones after their ammunition was exhausted, and had
even fired away their buttons as bullets. Their gallant conduct was
commemorated by wearing a "splash" on their buttons for many years
afterwards. In 1831 while on service in India, cholera carried off
nearly the whole regiment, there being at one time only two men not on
the sick list or in hospital. The 2nd Battalion (99th Foot) was raised
in 1824. Both battalions have splendid records of war service.

Nicknamed: "The Springers," from the rapidity of its pursuit of the
American rebels after the action at Trois Rivieres, in Canada, 1776;
also "The Splashers" and "The Moonrakers."

THE MANCHESTER REGIMENT


The 1st Battalion was raised in 1758, and after a brief spell of
service on the Continent went to the West Indies and America, winning
high praise for gallant conduct at the battle of Entaw. For very many
years the regiment did splendid service in the West Indies, adding much
territory to the British Empire, and was afterwards sent to Australia
and New Zealand. Excellent service was rendered in the Crimea, India,
and Afghanistan, the "Regimental Order of Merit" being founded with
power to grant medals or badges, for specially gallant conduct. The
regiment has served with honour in all parts of the Empire.

The Officers of the 63rd previous to 1855 wore a _fleur-de-lis_ in
gold embroidery at the end of their coat-tails. At one time the whole
regiment appears to have worn a _fleur-de-lis_ badge, which was adopted
in 1815 for services rendered at Guadaloupe.

The 1st Battalion (63rd Foot) nicknamed "Bloodsuckers," at one time.
The 2nd Battalion (96th Foot) was called "The Bendovers."

THE PRINCE OF WALES'S (North Staffordshire Regiment)


The 1st Battalion (64th Foot) was raised in 1756, the facings being
black. It took part in the hardest fighting in the West Indies and
America, being engaged there off and on till 1815, reaching home just
too late to take part in the battle of Waterloo. The regiment was on
board the "Alert," when she was wrecked near Halifax, N.S., all ranks
remaining below silent and under perfect discipline, while the vessel
was run ashore. Had the men attempted to reach the deck the vessel
would have foundered. By their discipline everyone aboard was saved,
and the Duke of Wellington ordered that the details should be published
throughout the Army as an example of discipline. The 2nd Battalion
(98th Foot) was raised in 1824 and served in the Crimean War. The 98th
was honoured with the title of "Prince of Wales's" in recognition of
the duties performed by the Corps during the Prince of Wales's visit to
Malta.

Nicknamed: "The Black Knots" as distinct from "The Staffordshire Knots"
of the South Staffordshire Regiment.

YORK & LANCASTER REGIMENT


Raised in 1756 and was present at the capture of Guadaloupe. Active
service in the West Indies reduced the ranks to such an extent that on
its return it had to take large drafts of "parish boys." In 1801 the
"boy" regiment was sent to the Cape to get acclimatised for service in
India, where it arrived two years later, and where it stayed for over
twenty years earning a high reputation for bravery and discipline.
Later, another long spell of foreign service was put in, serving for
no fewer than twenty years in Australia and New Zealand, a unique
experience. The 2nd Battalion was raised as the 84th Foot in 1793 at
York, and saw a great deal of foreign and active service, part being
among the small garrison of Lucknow during the Mutiny, the rest of the
84th being massacred at Cawnpore. The brilliant record of service of
the regiment has been added to since those days.

THE DURHAM LIGHT INFANTRY


No regiment has earned a prouder title than the Durhams, that of "The
Faithful Durhams" having been bestowed for devoted service on many
a hard won battlefield and for years of arduous service faithfully
performed. The 1st Battalion (68th Foot) was raised in 1756 by General
John Lambton of the Coldstream Guards, and was soon on active service
on the Continent, followed by active service in the West Indies. For
nine years, the 68th garrisoned Gibraltar, and afterwards took part
in the capture of St. Lucia, 1795, and St. Vincent. In the Peninsula,
it added to its already high reputation, which it has since so well
enhanced on the Continent. The 2nd Battalion (106th Foot) was raised
in India in 1826 by the East India Company as the 2nd Bombay European
Regiment, serving with credit in many actions in India and Persia,
coming to England for the first time in 1871.

HIGHLAND LIGHT INFANTRY


The regiment has one of the most brilliant records in the whole army,
a reputation it splendidly maintained against the Germans in France
and Belgium. The 1st Battalion (71st Foot) dates from 1777 as Fraser's
Highlanders, which afterwards became Macleod's Highlanders, fighting
with distinguished bravery in India, South Africa, the Peninsula,
Waterloo and elsewhere. The 2nd Battalion (74th Foot) has an equally
brilliant record of Indian and foreign service, winning great glory
at the battle of Assaye, where every officer was killed or wounded
and the remainder of the regiment was brought out of action by the
Sergeant-Major.

The 1st Battalion was so full of Glasgow men during the Peninsular War,
that it was generally known as "The Glesca Keelies."

SEAFORTH HIGHLANDERS (Rossshire Buffs, the Duke of Albany's)


The 1st Battalion (72nd Highlanders) was raised by the chief of the
Clan Mackenzie in 1778. The regiment gave early evidence of that great
bravery which has ever marked it, especially in India and Afghanistan,
and took part in the whole of the Egyptian and Soudan expeditions
from the attack at Tel-el-Kebir to the final battle at Omdurman. The
2nd Battalion (78th Highlanders) claim descent from the famous Fraser
Highlanders of 1756, being reorganized at Aberdeen in 1793 as the
Rossshire Buffs and has an equally glorious record.

Nickname: 1st Battalion, "The Macraes"; 2nd Battalion, "King's Men,"

THE GORDON HIGHLANDERS


"The Gay Gordons," as the regiment has always been known, are the
lineal descendants of that famous regiment raised in 1787, mainly
by the beautiful Duchess of Gordon, who bestowed on each recruit a
kiss. The regiment saw a great deal of service in India, notably the
storming of Seringapatam. Service in the Mediterranean and South Africa
followed, and the regiment was back in India in time to take part in
some of the severest fighting in the Mutiny. Brilliant service in other
parts of the Empire followed. The 2nd Battalion (92nd Highlanders)
trace their history back to 1794, and fought in India, the Peninsula
and at Waterloo with great credit. Many famous officers have commenced
their military careers in the Gordon Highlanders.

THE QUEEN'S OWN CAMERON HIGHLANDERS


The regiment (79th Foot) was raised by Cameron of Erracht in 1793 in
Inverness-shire almost entirely from among his own kinsmen, and down to
the present day the Clan Cameron is still very strong in the regiment.
For many years the 79th Highlanders was the only single battalion
regiment in the army, the 2nd Battalion being raised during the South
African War. A remarkable fact in connection with the regiment was
that although they had over 700 officers and men down with typhus
on returning from Corunna in 1809, they did not lose a single man,
and six months later embarked for the ill-fated Walcheren expedition
1,002 strong. They served in the trenches throughout the whole of that
campaign without losing a man.

THE ROYAL IRISH RIFLES


The regiment was raised in 1793 in Dublin by Col. Fitch, and became
known as "Fitch's Grenadiers," the title being bestowed in humorous
allusion to the small stature of the men. They, however, soon showed
they could fight as well as the finest grenadiers in the Army,
reaping glory in many a hot engagement during the succeeding years.
The regiment was converted into Rifles in 1881 when the 86th Foot
was linked with the 83rd as sister battalion. The 86th regiment was
raised in 1792, as the Royal County Downs, and served for some years
as marines, and later in Egypt. During the ten succeeding years the
regiment travelled twice round Africa, served in India and the Red Sea,
twice crossed the Egyptian Desert, served in South Africa, Ceylon, and
elsewhere, the service being so strenuous that during five years in
India over a thousand men laid down their lives. The fine physique of
the ranks earned for them the name of the "Irish Giants."

PRINCESS VICTORIA'S (Royal Irish Fusiliers)


The 1st Battalion (87th Foot) was raised by General Doyle in Ireland
in 1793 and was fighting in 1794 in Belgium and afterwards saw a
great deal of rough service in South America. It was, however, in the
Peninsular War that it earned undying fame, charging the enemy who
were in greatly superior numbers, at Barrosa, with such fury as to
overthrow them, and led to the capture of an eagle by Sergt. Patrick
Masterman, whose grandson won a V.C. in South Africa. In recognition of
its splendid bravery the regiment was given a Royal title and directed
to display an eagle as badge. The regiment has exhibited the same high
standard of bravery in all its subsequent campaigns. The 2nd Battalion
(89th Foot), raised in 1793, also made a splendid name for courage.

THE CONNAUGHT RANGERS


The 1st Battalion (88th Foot) dates from 1793, being raised in
Connaught, and was known then by the same title it still bears. It
has had a most adventurous career, being shipwrecked and seeing hard
service in India, Egypt, Ceylon, and South America, and subsequently
joining Wellington in the Peninsula, winning high distinction in many
battles, especially at the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajos. In
1819 the regiment was given permission to create a regimental order
of merit, the 1st class being for those who had been in twelve or
more general actions, and no fewer than 70 rank and file then serving
qualified, there being nearly 130 who had been in from six to eleven
actions, and over four hundred who had served in one to five actions.
The 2nd Battalion (94th Foot) dates from 1823.

Nickname: "The Devil's Own," called so by General Picton for their
undaunted bravery in face of the enemy; also "The Garvies."

The 98th Highlanders (Argyllshire) was raised in 1796 and renumbered
the 91st Highlanders in 1802, its constant war service being in South
Africa where it helped to capture the Cape of Good Hope from the
Dutch and took part in the first Kaffir War. It afterwards went to
the Peninsula and fought in many of the battles there, winning great
fame. Afterwards it served many years in the Mediterranean and in
India, taking a full share in the fierce battles of the Mutiny. The
2nd Battalion, raised in 1800 as the Sutherland Highlanders, won its
greatest glory in the Crimea where in line, under the brave Colin
Campbell, it received unsupported the full charge of the Russian
Cavalry and drove them off in confusion.

Known after the Battle of Balaklava as "The Thin Red Line," also called
"The Rory's."

THE PRINCE OF WALES'S LEINSTER REGIMENT (Royal Canadians)


The Leinster Regiment is the only British corps having a Colonial
title. The 1st Battalion (100th Foot) was raised in Canada in 1858, and
has, by marked gallantry in India, South Africa and Belgium, added much
to the glory of the British Army. The 2nd Battalion (109th Foot) was
raised in India in 1853. The regiment has many curious nicknames, those
applying to the 1st Battalion being "The Crusaders," "The Centipedes,"
on account of its regimental number, the 100th, "The Beavers," the
"Old Hundredth," and "The Colonials." At one time the colours used to
be decorated with maple leaves on July 1st (Dominion Day), the maple
leaf being borne as part of the badge. The 2nd Battalion is known as
"The Poonah Pets" from its birthplace; "The Steel Heads" on account of
withstanding the excessive heat of the sun in Central India, and "The
Lilywhites" from its white facings. The regiment was the last British
infantry unit to be quartered in Canada, and the whole country parted
with them with regret.

THE ROYAL MUNSTER FUSILIERS


The 101st and 104th Regiments, combined to make up the Royal Munster
Fusiliers, are both of Indian origin and have left their names deeply
inscribed on the battles which gave that country to the Empire. The
101st was raised by Clive in India in 1756 as the Bengal European
Regiment and shared in all the hard fighting from Chandernagore to
Burmah, till the Mutiny brought them their crowning glory. After over
one hundred years' campaigning the regiment came to England for the
first time in 1868. The 2nd Battalion (the 104th Regiment) was formed
in 1839 in Bengal and also did splendid service in the Mutiny and in
the Burmah campaign.

Nickname: "The Dirty Shirts," a cherished name given them as a result
of fighting in their shirt sleeves at Delhi, in 1857.

THE ROYAL DUBLIN FUSILIERS


The regiment is the oldest of the old Indian regiments. It was raised
in India in the reign of Charles I., but in 1748 it became the Madras
European Regiment, and under Clive rendered splendid service at many
famous Indian battles which gradually won that Empire for the British
Crown. The 2nd Battalion (103rd Foot) has an equally glorious Indian
record. After 223 years of Indian service the 1st Battalion came to
England for the first time in 1868, and in 1870 the 2nd Battalion came
home for the first time after 209 years service.

Nicknames: "The Blue Caps." During the Indian Mutiny, Nana Sahib warned
his men against those "blue-capped soldiers who fought like devils."
"The Old Toughs," from the long period of hard service in India.

THE RIFLE BRIGADE (The Prince Consort's Own)


Raised in 1800 the regiment saw active service before a year was out in
the attack on Ferrol. A detachment was on Nelson's flagship as marines
at the battle of the Baltic. Their courage was favourably commented
upon at Waterloo where they rendered particularly valuable service at
a critical period. In all parts of the world the Rifle Brigade have
rendered devoted service to King and Country, and have fully earned and
maintained the reputation that won for them the eulogy of King William
IV, who said "Wherever there has been fighting, there you have been,
and wherever you have been you have distinguished yourselves."

Nicknames: "The Greenjackets" and "The Sweeps."

ARMY SERVICE CORPS


The Army Service Corps has no counterpart in any European Army, and
has been evolved from years of warfare in all parts of the world. The
result, as proved in the great war on the Continent, is to place the
Corps in the forefront of any similar service among the Allies, and
the Corps has been the wonder of the armies of the world. The Corps is
the outcome of experience gained in the organisation of several corps
which had been formed for special purposes and afterwards disbanded.
The present high standard of efficiency of the Corps is due to the fact
that it has been slowly but surely recognised by Generals in command
of military expeditions that the ultimate success of their operations
depended primarily on the efficiency of the supply and transport
service, and so with the flight of years the Corps has been grudgingly
given that degree of importance in the Army it has so well merited.
It has gone through many transformations from the Commissaries of
Muster, Royal Waggon Train, Land Transport Corps, Military Train, and
Commissariat and Transport Corps to its present designation and duties.

When it was the Military Train it was called "Moke Train." Popularly
known as "The Commos."

ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS


The Corps dates its present organization from 1873 when the old
regimental medical system was abolished, which had many weaknesses
and was open to considerable abuse. The reorganisation has been
greatly to the benefit of the whole Army for it has provided a medical
service far superior in skill, organization and establishment to any
medical service in the world. Not only is the professional skill of
the medical officers and the nursing skill of the men the best that
the nation can provide, but the sympathy and devotion to their humane
duties evinced by all ranks is a theme of constant admiration, and one
of the most glorious traditions of the Army. In the hottest and most
dangerous areas of the battlefield, in the dread infectious wards of
the hospitals, and in their care of the sick and wounded, the members
of the Corps have shown a devotion and bravery that has reflected the
utmost glory on the whole nation. Many of the Officers and other ranks
have won the highest and most coveted decorations on the field in
discharging their splendid mission of saving life.

Nicknames: "Linseed Lancers," and "Poultice Wallopers."

ARMY VETERINARY SERVICE AND ARMY VETERINARY CORPS


This humane service was brought into being in 1796. Previously the
treatment of equine diseases in the service had been entrusted to the
farriers, zealous, but for the most part ignorant, men working by
rule of thumb. The founding of the Royal Veterinary College, London,
just prior to that period helped materially in putting the corps on a
sound professional basis, and the diploma of the College was a _sine
qua non_ for a commission in the Corps. The first Veterinary Surgeon
appears to have been Mr. John Ship, who was appointed to the 11th Light
Dragoons in June 1796 and a few months later Professor Coleman of the
Royal Veterinary College was appointed Principal Veterinary Surgeon
to the Cavalry and Senior Veterinary Surgeon to the Ordnance. Under
his energetic guidance the foundations of our splendidly efficient
Veterinary service were laid. The service was re-organised in 1881, all
regimental appointments, except those in the Household Cavalry, being
abolished, and in 1891 substantive military rank was conferred on the
officers instead of relative rank. The South African war brought a
further development in the inclusion of N.C.O.'s and men in the Corps,
and now the Corps musters a very strong body of experts whose services
have been of inestimable value in the great war on the Continent.

Nicknames: "The Vets"; "The Horse Doctors."

ARMY ORDNANCE DEPARTMENT AND ARMY ORDNANCE CORPS


It is a remarkable fact that the Ordnance Department has a greater
antiquity than any other branch of the Army, its history being
traceable to the earliest military organisation of England. At one
time it was a civilian department, then a branch of the Artillery,
then a branch of the Engineers, and so curiously interwoven that it
is very difficult to establish its actual origin. The first official
record of an Ordnance Department dates back to 1418, when John Louth
was appointed "Clerk to the Ordnance." The Master Bowyer, Master
Fletcher, Master Carpenter, etc., were styled Officers of the Ordnance,
which about 1455 became centralised at the Tower of London, where
the Department continued for four hundred years under "The Master
of the Ordnance," until removed to Woolwich. The duties have been,
as now, closely associated with the provision and care of war-like
stores, especially arms and ammunition, and the designation of the
Department has varied considerably, the efficiency of the Department
being steadily increased and splendidly maintained in the face of great
difficulties.

Nicknamed "The Ordnance" and "The Sugar Stick Brigade" from the
peculiar red and white piping of the braid.

ARMY PAY DEPARTMENT AND ARMY PAY CORPS


Before the establishment of the Army Pay Department in 1878, the
financial side of the soldier's service was administered almost without
system, this being carried out for the greater part according to the
whim or skill of each commanding officer. So many people "had a finger
in the pie" in handling the soldier's pay that the wonder is that any
ever reached him at all, whilst the loss to the nation was enormous.
After the abolition of the system under which each Colonel paid his
men or did not, as he thought fit, Army Agents were made more or less
responsible for paying the troops, and these appointed their own
paymasters in each regiment. This system was open to abuse, and the
troops suffered until the whole system of pay was taken over by the War
Office and the Pay Department established. This Department also took
over the payment for all the needs of the regiments and corps, and so
well has it arranged its duties that every man in the army is now sure
of every penny due to him, whilst the nation has been saved vast sums
by preventing fraud and overcharging.

MILITARY POLICE


The formation of this Corps is comparatively a recent one, for
until the year 1880 police duties in times of peace were discharged
regimentally, and in times of war by more or less haphazard detachments
under selected officers known as Provost Marshals. The formation of
the Military Mounted and Foot Police, however, placed this important
work on more solid and organised foundations, and in war and peace the
members of the Corps discharge, in a most efficient manner, a large
variety of important duties few are aware of. The policing of camps,
lines of communication, supply bases and other important centres is
only part of their work, which include the custody of prisoners of war,
the safeguarding of general officers, and the execution of spies and
other condemned prisoners.

ROYAL MARINES


The evolutions of the Marines as a separate force before the accession
of Queen Anne are little known. The earliest mention of Marines as
a distinct force occurs in 1664, being an Order in Council for the
formation of a body of 1,200 men for the sea service. Many infantry
regiments have in their early days served as Marines, but the separate
Corps seems to have had a corporate existence since the date mentioned
above. Splendid service has been rendered on land and sea ever since,
and the Marines are as justly considered as being among the best
fighting men the Empire has. Their records show them to have taken
important parts in many a famous battle on land, whilst contributing
their share to every victory afloat.

The Royal Marines were, by the French, nicknamed "The Little
Grenadiers," from the regiment wearing Grenadier caps. They are
popularly known as "The Jollies." The Corps was originally raised for
sea service alone. In 1664 it bore the name of "The Admiral's Regiment"
in consequence, and "Neptune's Bodyguard."
